In adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections without evidence of pneumonia how does the administration timing or lack of antibiotics correlate to reconsultation for non-resolving symptoms hospital admission or death?,Antibiotics have not demonstrated clear benefit when administered for acute uncomplicated (e.g. no pneumonia or lung abscess) ambulatory community based lower respiratory tract infections in clinical trials[1] or in a Cochrane review.[2],/wiki/3C,,
In critically ill patients requiring central venous access how do complications vary by central venous catheter (CVC) access site?,Central venous catheters (CVCs) are associated with infrequent but potentially severe complications including catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) DVT and pneumothorax. A 2001 French randomized study demonstrated that subclavian insertion was associated with fewer infectious and thrombotic complications than femoral insertion but internal jugular (IJ) insertion was not studied.[1] A 2012 meta-analysis of mostly nonrandomized studies suggested that the subclavian approach may be associated with fewer infectious complications than femoral or IJ insertions. However it concluded that a randomized trial was necessary to confirm the rates of these complications by access site.[2],/wiki/3SITES,,
Among patients with prior MI or angina with hyperlipidemia does addition of simvastatin reduce all-cause mortality when compared to placebo?,"Hyperlipidemia was first identified as a risk factor for CAD in a publication from the Framingham Study group (1961).[1] Early trials with cholesterol modifying agents had modest success. LRC-CPPT (1984)[2] demonstrated a significant 1.6% absolute reduction in fatal or non-fatal MI at 7 years with use of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine in patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia. The Helsinki Heart Study (1987)[3] demonstrated a similar reduction in the incidence of CAD with the fibrate gemfibrozil men hyperlipidemia. Neither trial demonstrated a mortality benefit. A new class of cholesterol-lowering medications called ""statins"" lowered cholesterol by reducing endogenous production through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Their role in patients with CAD resultant to their hyperlipidemia was unclear.",/wiki/4S,,
In ICU patients aged ≥65 years with vasodilatory hypotension what is the effect on 90 day mortality by reducing the vasopressor exposure through permissive hypotension of target MAP of 60-65 mmHg?,The single-center Rivers Trial (2001) found a mortality benefit from an Early Goal Directed Therapy (EGDT) strategy including several interventions including MAP >65 mm Hg with vasopressors as needed. There is a dearth of evidence to support this specific MAP target and subsequent multicenter sepsis studies comparing the protocol from the Rivers Trial versus other care patterns were largely negative (e.g. ProCESS 2014; ARISE 2014; ProMISe 2015). These subsequent studies assessed the entire EGDT protocol versus other standards. Whether a higher MAP target alone provided benefit in vasodilatory shock among adults in the ICU was unclear. The use of vasopressor medications to achieve this MAP might introduce unneeded harm to the patients with shock since they involve shunting of the patients blood away from some areas in the body and risk of arrhythmias. ,/wiki/65_Trial,,
Among self-identified black patients with HFrEF does the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine improve survival compared to placebo?,Self-identified black individuals may have less activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) rendering ACE inhibitors ARBs and beta-blockers relatively less effective.[1] A subgroup analysis of self-described black patients in V-HeFT (1986) was the first to suggest a survival benefit to isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN)/hydralazine a combination that targets non-RAAS pathways leading to increased nitric oxide and decreased reactive oxygen species.,/wiki/A-HeFT,,
Among African Americans with hypertensive kidney disease does intensive blood pressure control slow progression of CKD more than usual BP control?,African American adults experience a disproportionate burden of hypertension and hypertension-related chronic kidney disease when compared to white Americans.[1][2] One small analysis from the MDRD trial suggested a potential benefit in prevention progression of kidney disease with intensive BP control.[3] However the appropriate management of these interrelated conditions was unknown in the 1990s.,/wiki/AASK,,
In patients with symptomatic (NYHA II-III) heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%) and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) chosen for a rhythm control strategy is AF ablation superior to amiodarone with regard to AF-free survival?,Multiple RCTs including the landmark AFFIRM trial (2002) have demonstrated similar outcomes with a rate control strategy (i.e. use of AV nodal blockade to attain a safe heart rate with no intent to restore sinus rhythm) versus a rhythm control strategy (i.e. use of antiarrhythmic drugs [AAD] or procedures to restore and maintain sinus rhythm) in patients with AF. Nevertheless these initial trials included primarily older patients without structural heart disease and in particular patients with significant LV dysfunction were underrepresented. The later AF-CHF trial (2008) however specifically studied patients with concomitant AF and systolic HF and again found no significant difference in outcomes with rate versus rhythm control.,/wiki/AATAC,,
Among patients with HTN at high risk for CV complications how does benazepril/amlodipine compare to benazepril/HCTZ in reducing cardiovascular events?,No single antihypertensive has proven significantly better than others for the general population. The large comparative ALLHAT trial (2002) did not clearly demonstrate difference between a single-agent diuretic ACE inhibitor or CCB although it suggested that chlorthalidone (not widely used in the US) may be preferable. Two or more medications are required to control most hypertensives[1] which raises the question of whether trials should study head-to-head comparisons of single agents. The ACCOMPLISH trial sought to compare combination ACE inhibitors plus diuretic to combination ACE inhibitor plus CCB in terms of rates of CV events and death.,/wiki/ACCOMPLISH,,
In patients with T2DM does intensive glycemic control targeting a HbA1c <6% versus standard glycemic control targeting a HbA1c 7-7.9% reduce the risk of CV events?,Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM. The 2005 EDIC (an extension of the 1993 DCCT trial) demonstrated that improved glycemic control reduces the rate of long-term CVD in patients with T1DM. However this macrovascular outcome had not been replicated in similar trials in patients with T2DM (including the 1998 UKPDS 33).  Whether patients with T2DM have reduced incidence of CVD with near-euglycemic control (i.e. pushing the HbA1C goal <7%) was unclear.,/wiki/ACCORD,,
In patients with T2DM at high risk for CV events does intensive BP control (SBP <120 mmHg) reduce rates of nonfatal MI nonfatal stroke or CV mortality when compared to standard BP control (SBP <140 mmHg)?,Patients with T2DM are at elevated risk for CVD. HTN is an independent risk factor for CVD. The JNC 7 recommended targeting SBP to 130 mmHg despite a lack of large RCTs supporting this recommendation. ,/wiki/ACCORD_BP,,
Among adults with T2DM on statin monotherapy does addition of a fibrate reduce risk of CVD?,Adults with T2DM experience excess morbidity and mortality from CVD.[1] Atherogenic cholesterol subtypes and inflammation are thought to be on the causal pathway of CVD.[2] Statins promote a more optimal lipid profile through suppression of HMG-CoA reductase and reduce inflammation through their effects on multiple pathways.[3] Multiple studies have found statins to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD in various populations. Among adults with T2DM CARDS (2004) found atorvastatin to reduce the hazard of CVD endpoints by 37%. However CVD remained elevated at 1.54/100 person-years during the follow-up period. Whether further optimization of lipids with non-statin medications would benefit diabetics was unknown. ,/wiki/ACCORD_Lipid,,
Among T1-2 breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy undergoing lumpectomy and whole-breast radiation does axillary lymph node dissection improve survival or local control compared to nodal observation?,Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has historically been a means of maintaining regional control of breast cancer especially in patients with initial presentation of metastatic nodal disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a commonly used method of detecting micrometastatic axillary disease at initial presentation. Due to the significant morbidity of ALND including paresthesias lymphedema seroma and infection judicious use of the procedure is important. The randomized NSABP B-32 study demonstrated that patients with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) could be spared ALND.[1] Whether ALND might be avoided in patients with clinically negative axillary nodes and fewer than 3 positive sentinel lymph nodes was unknown. ,/wiki/ACOSOG_Z0011,,
Among patients undergoing coronary and peripheral vascular angiography does acetylcysteine reduce the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury?,Acetylcysteine reduces oxidative stress[1] and may improve renal perfusion.[2] Numerous small or otherwise low-quality trials have been published investigating whether acetylcysteine reduced the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients undergoing angiography.  ,/wiki/ACT,,
Among patients with atrial fibrillation who are not suitable candidates for vitamin K antagonists does the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduce the risk of vascular events compared to aspirin alone?,AF was first identified as a risk factor for stroke in a 1978 Framingham study publication.[1][2] The 1991 SPAF study[3] demonstrated the superiority of warfarin over aspirin in stroke prevention in AF. Despite the benefits of anticoagulation many patients with AF do not receive such therapy because of a known or perceived risk of bleeding or another factor that renders VKAs unsuitable. For years such patients had been prescribed aspirin or combination aspirin/clopidogrel although the comparative efficacy of these strategies had not yet been rigorously studied until ACTIVE A.,/wiki/ACTIVE_A,,
Among patients with nonvalvular AF how does combination aspirin/clopidogrel compare to warfarin in reducing the incidence of stroke systemic embolism MI or CV death?,The 2006 Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE W) randomized 6706 patients with nonvalvular AF and one or more additional risk factors for stroke to open treatment with either aspirin/clopidogrel or warfarin. At a mean follow-up of 1.3 years combination aspirin/clopidogrel was inferior to anticoagulation at reducing the composite incidence of stroke non-CNS systemic embolus MI or CV death (annual risk 5.6% vs. 3.9%) and was associated with increased bleeding (15.4% vs. 13.2%). A post hoc subgroup analysis suggested that anticoagulation conferred no benefit over antiplatelet therapy among patients receiving low-quality anticoagulation (ie those time in therapeutic range <58%).,/wiki/ACTIVE_W,,
Among patients hospitalized for Covid-19 with lower respiratory tract involvement does remdesivir reduce the time to recovery?,Originally developed as a treatment for the Ebola virus remdesivir is a prodrug adenosine analogue that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of several RNA viruses. Remdesivir was identified as a potentially promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of Covid-19 after preclinical investigations discovered in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 as well as related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.,/wiki/ACTT-1,,
Does administration of cisatracurium improve survival when compared to placebo in ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for early severe ARDS?,The high mortality of ARDS -- up to 46% at 60 days[1] -- has been improved upon by only a few interventions most notably the ARDSNet (2000) low tidal volume protocol. Therapeutic paralysis has been used in synergy with sedation to improve mechanical ventilation. However its role as a treatment modality for ARDS was unclear.,/wiki/ACURASYS,,
In patients older than 50 presenting to the ED with clinically-suspected PE is using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff versus conventional cutoff (>500 µg/L) associated with an increased diagnostic yield?,Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening disorder that is frequently considered in the emergency medicine differential diagnoses. Given its significant morbidity and mortality it must be rapidly ruled out. The presentation of PE is often non-specific and diagnostic testing and treatment can be associated with significant adverse events. D-dimer testing with a threshold of 500 μg/L has been shown to be a highly sensitive test with a correspondingly high negative predictive value among patients with low pretest probability for PE. However several studies have shown that D-dimer levels increase with age thereby limiting the yield and cost-effectiveness of D-dimer testing among older patients.[1][2] Retrospective and meta-analysis studies suggested that a simple age adjustment (age × 10 in patients >50 years) may better define an optimal D-dimer cutoff value among older patients.[3][4] ADJUST-PE sought to prospectively validate this method.,/wiki/ADJUST-PE,,
In patients with septic shock requiring ventilatory and vasopressor support does a continuous week-long infusion of hydrocortisone 200 mg/day improve mortality at 90 days when compared to placebo?,Multiple RCTs have investigated the potential role for steroid therapy in patients with septic shock. The Annane Trial in 2002 with 299 patients demonstrated a short-term mortality benefit with IV hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone among patients with evidence of adrenal insufficiency on ACTH stimulation testing. CORTICUS with 499 patients in 2008 investigated hydrocortisone in patients with and without adrenal insufficiency and found a faster reversal of shock but no benefit in either subgroup with suggestion of increased infection rates in patients receiving hydrocortisone. HYPRESS in 2016 with 380 patients showed no difference in mortality but showed decrease time to reversal of shock.,/wiki/ADRENAL,,
In patients with T2DM what are the vascular effects of intensive glycemic therapy targeting a HbA1c ≤6.5%?,In the 2008 ADVANCE trial sulfonylurea-based intensive glycemic therapy targeting a HbA1c ≤6.5% was associated with a 10% reduction in combined micro- and macrovascular events compared with standard therapy. This was largely driven by a 23% reduction in the risk of microvascular events principally nephropathy. There was no reduction in the risk of macrovascular events.,/wiki/ADVANCE,,
Among patients with AF and HFrEF does rhythm-control reduce cardiovascular mortality as compared to rate control?,The AFFIRM trial showed that among patients with non-valvular AF there was no significant mortality difference between rate-control and rhythm-control strategies. There are specific issues related to patients with AF and heart failure (HF). Heart failure patients have a higher risk of developing AF. They are also at a higher risk for adverse effect from certain anti-arrhythmic drugs. Hence the investigators aimed to determine if rhythm-control would reduce cardiovascular mortality as compared to rate control.,/wiki/AF-CHF,,
Among patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death what are the effects of rate control versus rhythm control on mortality?,The 2002 Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial was the first and largest study to compare rate-control and rhythm-control strategies for the treatment of AF. Among 4060 patients with non-valvular AF and a high risk of stroke or death AFFIRM demonstrated no survival advantage between rate-control (using ß-blocker calcium channel blocker and/or digoxin) and rhythm-control strategies.  All patients were anticoagulated on warfarin initially but patients in the rhythm control arm who maintained normal sinus rhythm for at least 4 consecutive weeks could stop.  In fact there was a nonsignificant trend toward a decrease in mortality associated with the rate-control strategy particularly those aged ≥65 and those without a history of HF.  However rates of ischemic stroke were similar between both groups at approximately 1% per year.,/wiki/AFFIRM,,
Among eligible women does initiation of breast cancer screening with mammograms at age 40-41 reduce breast cancer mortality when compared to initiation at age 50?,Screening mammography to reduce breast cancer mortality in women was demonstrated as effective in multiple trials including the 1971 HIP[1] and 1985 Swedish Two Counties[2] studies. Evidence supporting screening before the age of 50 years was lacking.[3] Publications addressing the utility of screening in women age 40-49 were were largely secondary analyses of larger population screening trials.[4] As mammography is associated with multiple potential harms including psychological distress from false-positives pain overdiagnosis overtreatment[5] and radiation exposure[6] whether to screen women age 40-49 years old has been controversial.,/wiki/Age_Trial,,
In patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are bioresorbable scaffolds superior to standard drug-eluting stents (DES) with regard to target-vessel failure?,Although current second-generation DES are the best established and most efficacious means of achieving and maintaining coronary artery patency in the setting of obstructive CAD they are still associated with an ongoing risk of stent thrombosis (approximately 0.1-0.2% per year) and in-stent restenosis (2-3% per year). Theoretically recently developed biosorbable metallic scaffolds leave no permanent implant and thus may allow for better restoration of natural vessel function after revascularization. The ABSORB-III trial demonstrated noninferiority with the bioresorbable scaffold versus everolimus-eluting DES with regard to target-vessel patency at 1 year. However multiple observational studies as well as longer-term follow up of the related ABSORB II trial suggest that scaffolds may be associated with higher medium-term device failure rates than DES. [1][2] Nevertheless scaffolds have been approved for use by the FDA and the EU and have already begun to achieve significant clinical use. A longer-term RCT investigating the comparative efficacy and safety of scaffolds vs. DES was needed.,/wiki/AIDA,,
In patients with colchicine-resistant steroid-dependent recurrent pericarditis does the IL-1B antagonist anakinra reduce recurrent pericarditis compared to placebo?,Recurrent pericarditis is a major clinical problem affecting up to 30% of patients after a first episode of acute pericarditis and up to 50% of patients after a first recurrence when colchicine is not used[1]. As shown in the ICAP trial upfront combined therapy with both colchicine and anti-inflammatory agents is effective in reducing risk of recurrence after acute pericarditis but even with this therapy recurrence still occurs around 20% of the time. Although oral steroids are often effective in treating recurrent pericarditis patients who require steroids for this indication often have difficulty with recurrence when steroids are weaned off and are therefore exposed to the myriad side effects of long-term steroid therapy. Whether the addition of more novel anti-inflammatory agents may allow for steroid-sparing therapy in refractory recurrent pericarditis is unclear although there have been suggestions from retrospective studies and case series that anakinra may be effective in this setting.,/wiki/AIRTRIP,,
Among ICU patients with AKI does early renal replacement therapy (RRT) reduce mortality as compared to delayed RRT?,Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a life-saving intervention among critically-ill patients with severe AKI. However some of these patients with severe AKI spontaneously recover renal function and may not need urgent RRT. While RRT is generally well-tolerated it is associated with procedure-related complications (eg line infections). Conversely early removal of uremic toxins may provide benefit among the critically-ill.  As such the timing of initiation of RRT was a matter of debate among critically-ill patients with severe AKI. ,/wiki/AKIKI,,
Among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock does administration of albumin 20% solution to maintain serum albumin level ≥3 g/dL (≥30 g/L) reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days when compared to no albumin?,Selection of volume for resuscitation in ICU patients was addressed in the 2004 SAFE trial which compared albumin and crystalloids. In the severe sepsis subgroup in SAFE albumin demonstrated a non-significant trend towards lower all-cause mortality at 28 days with albumin (P=0.09). A 2006 pilot trial by Dubois et al.[1] suggested that daily IV albumin administration for serum albumin <3.1 g/dL (<31 g/L) may improve SOFA score (for organ function) for critically ill hypoalbuminemic patients. A large randomized controlled trial to evaluate for benefit of albumin in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock was lacking.,/wiki/ALBIOS,,
Among patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis treated with antibiotics does intravenous albumin reduce incident renal impairment and mortality when compared to antibiotics alone?,'Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection associated with cirrhosis that carries significant morbidity and mortality. While antibiotics mitigate some harm SBP survivors experience a high incidence of renal dysfunction.[1] The underlying mechanism of SBP''s harm are thought to be related to a decrease in effective arterial blood volume from the infection. As individuals with cirrhosis have a low baseline oncotic pressure renal perfusion is reduced leading to renal insufficiency. Albumin increases oncotic pressure over the short term and its administration may improve renal perfusion renal outcomes and mortality among those with SBP.  ',/wiki/Albumin_for_SBP,,
In patients with hypertension what is the efficacy of a calcium channel blocker ACE inhibitor or thiazide diuretic in lowering the incidence of CV events?,Hypertension is a major risk factor for numerous conditions including CAD. The optimal choice of antihypertensive for prevention of CAD endpoints was unclear. Published in 2002 the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) sought to determine which of four agents antihypertensive performed best in terms of fatal CAD and nonfatal MI. The study enrolled 33357 participants age ≥55 years with hypertension and at least one CAD risk factor. The study drug was instituted and additional open-label agents were added to achieve BP goals. The pragmatic ALLHAT found that compared to amlodipine chlorthalidone performed similarly in reducing overall incidence of CAD but decreased the incidence of HF. Compared to lisinopril chlorthalidone reduced overall CAD by 10% stroke by 15% HF by 19% and angina by 11%. The doxazosin arm was terminated prematurely because of a significantly increased risk of HF compared to chlorthalidone noted during an interim analysis. Following ALLHAT thiazides became widely used as first-line agents for essential hypertension.,/wiki/ALLHAT,,
In the ALLHAT-LLT study did patients aged ≥65 years with moderate hyperlipidemia and hypertension but without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) benefit from the addition of statin therapy in terms of all-cause mortality when compared to usual care alone?,Previous studies have quantified that 28% of patients 75-79 and 22% of patients 80 and older take statins for primary prevention[1] and statin use for primary prevention in patients older than 79 has increased from 8.8% in 1999-2000 to 34.1% in 2011-2012.[2] A 2015 Markov model reported that while statins may be cost effective for primary prevention in patients 75 years and older any benefit could be easily offset by an increase in adverse events.[3],/wiki/ALLHAT-LLT_Elderly,,
Among patients with active lupus nephritis is mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide for the induction of a renal response?,Clinically significant renal involvement occurs in approximately half of patients with lupus and renal histology in patients with lupus nephritis predicts responsiveness to therapy. Focal proliferative (class III) and diffuse proliferative (class  IV) lupus nephritis are mediated by immune and inflammatory mechanisms responsive to immunosuppression and antiinflammatory therapy and preferred therapy has generally been with a combination of prednisone plus cyclophosphamide based upon a landmark study from the NIH.[1] Due to the toxicities of cyclophosphamide including an increased risk of bladder toxicity and ovarian failure alternative strategies have been investigated such as reduced-dose and short-course cyclophosphamide as well as alternative immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Several studies have compared cyclophosphamide and MMF generally finding that MMF is equivalent to cyclophosphamide in terms of efficacy with a lower risk of ovarian failure.[2][3],/wiki/ALMS,,
In adult patients with symptomatic asthma who are currently using an inhaled corticosteroid or a long-acting bronchodilator does oral azithromycin decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations?,Optimal medical therapy for adults with asthma includes inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators but despite these interventions some patients have persistent symptoms. This led to the hypothesis that the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of azithromycin may reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life in these patients. Clinical data in the mid-2010s was too limited to inform the use of azithromycin among patients with persistent asthma.[1],/wiki/AMAZES,,
Among patients with acute VTE is apixaban non-inferior to conventional therapy with LMWH and vitamin K antagonists for symptomatic VTE recurrence VTE mortality or rates of bleeding?,The conventional treatment of VTE includes a heparin derivative (eg UFH or LMWH) usually followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA; eg warfarin). The new oral anticoagulants have promise as an alternative regimen for treatment of VTE as they do not require injections or frequent laboratory monitoring. RE-COVER (2009; dabigatran) EINSTEIN-DVT (2010; rivaroxaban)[1] EINSTEIN-PE (2012; rivaroxaban) and Hokusai-VTE (2013; edoxaban)[2] demonstrated noninferiority to standard therapy with an acceptable bleeding profile. The efficacy of apixaban a factor Xa inhibitor like rivaroxaban had not yet been demonstrated in a large trial.  ,/wiki/AMPLIFY,,
In patients with VTE who have completed 6-12 months of anticoagulation does long-term apixaban treatment reduce recurrent VTE or all-cause mortality?,The rate of VTE recurrence is up to 11% in the first year alone[1] prompting investigators to study continued low-dose anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents in the secondary prevention of VTE. ASPIRE and WARFASA (both 2012) demonstrated that aspirin reduces VTE recurrence by 32% while AMPLIFY-EXT studied apixaban a factor Xa inhibitor.,/wiki/AMPLIFY-EXT,,
Among patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency do corticosteroids reduce 28-day mortality?,"Sepsis is associated with relative adrenal insufficiency and according to classical teaching this results in greater rates of shock and hypotension refractory to standard resuscitation measures including IV fluids and vasopressors. Thus a common practice has been to treat refractory shock with corticosteroids the so-called ""stress-dose steroids"" approach. Because of the immunosuppression that corticosteroids induce some have argued that corticosteroid administration should be limited to patients with documented adrenal insufficiency where the benefit of corticosteroids would theoretically be greatest. Regardless of rationale for decades corticosteroids have been in wide use among ICU physicians despite a paucity of strong supporting clinical trial data. The Annane Trial aimed to reverse this trend by investigating the role of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock and documented adrenal insufficiency.",/wiki/Annane_Trial,,
In healthy older adults what is the efficacy and safety of andexanet for reversing the anticoagulant effects of the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban or rivaroxaban?,Apixaban rivaroxaban and edoxaban are factor Xa inhibitors approved in the US for the management of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism. Like the low-molecular-weight heparins enoxaparin dalteparin and tinzaparin—but in contrast to dabigatran heparin and warfarin—factor Xa inhibitors lack an FDA approved reversal agent. ,/wiki/ANNEXA,,
In adults with potentially life-threatening acute major bleeding what is the efficacy and safety of andexanet alfa for reversing the anticoagulant effects of the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban rivaroxaban edoxaban or enoxaparin?,The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran apixaban and rivaroxaban are safe and effective alternatives to warfarin among patients with thromboembolism and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation as demonstrated in RE-LY AMPLIFY ROCKET AF and other large trials. While more convenient due to fixed dosing rather than requiring dose adjustments based on INR the DOACs have been limited by the lack of a highly efficacious method of reversal of their anticoagulant effect. RE-VERSE AD established the monoclonal antibody idarucizumab in reversing the anticoagulant effect of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy protein developed to reverse the effects of factor Xa inhibitors including enoxaparin apixaban and rivaroxaban.[1] On the basis of two studies in healthy volunteers in which andexanet alfa reversed the anticoagulant effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban (ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R) the FDA granted accelerated approval to andexanet alfa in May 2018 for the treatment of life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding in patients receiving either of these two factor Xa inhibitors.[2] Prospective studies were needed to demonstrate the efficacy of andexanet alfa in the management of patients with hemorrhage associated with factor Xa inhibitors. Additional studies are ongoing in a variety of patient populations and the present study represents an interim analysis of one such study.,/wiki/ANNEXA-4,,
Among men who have sex with men and are at high risk for HIV transmission does on-demand pre-exposure prophylaxis around the time of sex reduce the transmission of HIV?,Previously the 2010 IPrEx trial demonstrated that emtricitabine-tenofovir (TDF-FTC brand name Truvada) taken daily reduces the incidence of new HIV infections among seronegative men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk of HIV infection.[1] The drawbacks of daily use — including cost and the risk of renal insufficiency and Fanconi syndrome — drove investigators to evaluate the efficacy of as-needed pre-exposure prophylaxis.,/wiki/ANRS_IPERGAY,,
Among cirrhotic patients who present with GI bleed how does ceftriaxone compare to norfloxacin in reducing the rate of bacterial infections?,In 1992 a landmark trial by Soriano et al[1] demonstrated that norfloxacin reduces the incidence of bacterial infections and is associated with a nonsignificant trend towards improved survival among cirrhotic patients with GI bleed. Administration of antibiotics to these patients became considered standard-of-care soon thereafter. Subsequent epidemiologic studies revealed changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns with many quinolone-resistant bacteria causing infections in these patients. This prompted the current study which demonstrated the superiority of ceftriaxone over norfloxacin in reducing the rate of bacterial infections among cirrhotic patients with GI bleed. However a 2010 Cochrane review[2] did not find benefit of one antibiotic over another and therefore recommended antibiotic choice based upon local sensitivities.,/wiki/Antibiotics_in_Cirrhosis_with_Hemorrhage,,
Among adults on stable doses of antidepressant medications who are not currently depressed with ≥2 prior depressive episodes what was the risk of depression relapse among those randomized to maintenance of their current therapy vs. discontinuation of their therapy?,Depression is a common condition and antidepressants are commonly prescribed among adults with approximately 19% of US adults aged ≥60 taking an antidepressant medication.[1] The evidence supporting the use of contemporary antidepressant medications comes from short-term trials.[2] The role for long-term continuation of antidepressant medications is unclear. ,/wiki/ANTLER,,
Among acutely medically ill patients does extended thromboprophylaxis with betrixaban reduce the rate of VTE when compared with enoxaparin?,Hospitalized medically ill patients are at an increased risk of VTE during the hospitalization and following discharge. Randomized placebo-controlled trials including MEDENOX PREVENT and ARTEMIS demonstrated promise of in-hospital thromboprophylaxis with LMWH with a relative risk reduction of 45 to 63%.[1][2][3]  However medically ill patients may remain at risk for VTE during the post-discharge period with as many as 56.6% of all VTE events occurring after hospital discharge.[4] Studies such as MAGELLAN indicate that extended VTE prophylaxis with rivaroxaban may reduce rates of recurrent VTE at the expense of excess bleeding when compared to standard-course enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis. It is unclear whether extended anticoagulation with another DOAC may be efficacious without increasing the risk of clinically significant bleeding.,/wiki/APEX,,
Is antibiotic treatment for adult patients with acute appendicitis confirmed by computed tomography (CT) inferior compared to appendectomy?,Approximately 1 in 10 people undergo an appendectomy for acute appendicitis during their lifetime.[1] Despite the high incidence the efficacy of an antibiotics-only approach is of unknown efficacy. There has been one Cochrane analysis [2] and several meta-analyses [3][4][5][6][7] comparing antibiotic treatment to appendectomy. In general these trials were small and/or had eligibility criteria (e.g. no females) that limited generalizability. These trials showed that antibiotic therapy was inferior to appendectomy for acute appendicitis and the success rates of antibiotic treatment was 70-80% [8][9]. ,/wiki/APPAC,,
In adult patients with septic shock does low-dose hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone for 7 days affect overall survival at 90 days?,Multiple RCTs have investigated the potential role for steroid therapy in patients with septic shock with some studies suggesting a survival benefit (eg the Annane Trial) and others demonstrating no such benefit (eg CORTICUS HYPRESS and ADRENAL). With uncertainty about the role of steroids for patients with septic shock the authors of the present study redesigned a trial to add to the evidence.,/wiki/APROCCHSS,,
In patients with ALI/ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation how does a lung protective strategy using lower tidal volumes compare with traditional ventilation protocols in decreasing mortality and ventilator-free days? ,ARDS is mediated by alveolar damage from the release of inflammatory mediators.  Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation used tidal volumes of 10-15ml/kg PBW.  However multiple animal studies and observational studies showed that these large tidal volumes and the consequential elevated plateau pressures were associated with significant barotrauma.  ,/wiki/ARDSNet,,
In patients presenting to an emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock does early goal-directed therapy reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days when compared to usual care? ,"The single-center Rivers Trial (2001) demonstrated that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) conferred a mortality benefit among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Resuscitation using EGDT involved administration of fluids vasopressors and transfusion of RBCs guided by objective measurement of MAP CVP ScvO2 and UOP early after identification of the condition. The protocol was subsequently recommended for these conditions by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.[1] The utility of the protocol was called into question when the 2014 ProCESS trial did not find a mortality difference when EGDT was compared to either clinician-directed ""usual care"" or an alternative goal-directed resuscitation protocol. As ProCESS enrolled patients at academic medical centers it was unclear if EGDT would provide benefit for patients enrolled in a more heterogeneous environment.",/wiki/ARISE,,
Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and ≥1 stroke risk factor does apixaban reduce rates of stroke or systemic embolism in comparison to warfarin without increasing bleeding risks?,VKA therapy is the standard of care for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in AF but it has multiple drawbacks including drug-drug interactions need for frequent monitoring and dietary modification. Several drugs including dabigatran in RE-LY (2009) and rivaroxaban in ROCKET AF (2011) (and later edoxaban in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48)[1] have proven efficacious as alternatives to VKA therapy in AF. Like these other drugs apixaban an oral factor Xa inhibitor does not require monitoring has fewer drug-drug interactions and may therefore be advantageous clinically. Its efficacy had not yet been established in a large clinical trial however.,/wiki/ARISTOTLE,,
In adults with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia does the addition of rifampin to standard treatment reduce the incidence of disease recurrence treatment failure or death?,Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is a common life-threatening infection with an associated mortality of approximately 20%. Until ARREST was published in 2017 fewer than 1600 participants with SAB had been enrolled in randomized trials over the prior 50 years. A 2014 systematic review suggested a trend towards lower mortality and treatment failure with adjunctive rifampin but the evidence was weak.[1],/wiki/ARREST,,
In patients with multivessel coronary disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is bilateral internal mammary artery (BIMA) grafting superior to single IMA grafting with regard to overall mortality?,On the basis of multiple randomized trials including FREEDOM and BARI-2D coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has become the standard of care for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) particularly in the presence of diabetes. Use of the left internal mammary artery (IMA) as a graft conduit is almost always part of the surgical revascularization plan particularly given evidence suggesting improved long-term patency as compared to vein grafts. [1],/wiki/ART,,
In patients with diabetes with no established atherosclerotic disease does the use of low-dose aspirin reduce vascular events compared to placebo? Does low-dose aspirin significantly increase the risk of bleeding?,'Although it is well-accepted that aspirin is beneficial in reducing recurrent vascular events in patients with known vascular disease the role of aspirin as primary prevention therapy (i.e. therapy designed to reduce vascular events among patients without established atherosclerotic disease) is unclear despite being the focus of multiple studies. The 2009 Antithrombotic Trialists'' Collaboration meta-analysis involving 95000 patients in six primary prevention trials showed that aspirin use was associated with a 12% relative reduction in serious vascular events but was also associated with a 50% relative increase in bleeding.[1] The prevailing interpretation of these findings was that any benefit seen with aspirin as primary prevention was likely largely if not completely counterbalanced by increased bleeding risk. As a result of these data the USPSTF guidelines for primary prevention provide a grade B recommendation for aspirin use to prevent vascular events in a very circumscribed group of patients (age 50-59 estimated 10-yr ASCVD risk > 10%) at particularly high risk for vascular events but at low risk for bleeding due to younger age.',/wiki/ASCEND_(Aspirin),,
Among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis does pirfenidone reduce the composite rate of FVC decline or death when compared to placebo?,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with a median survival of 2-5 years for which few approved therapies exist.[1] Pirfenidone is an oral agent that reduces fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition via regulation of TGFβ and TNFα and has been shown to be active in preclinical IPF models.[1][2] Pirfenidone was investigated as a potential therapy for the disease in three phase 3 studies including SP3 (2010)[3] and the two CAPACITY trials (2010)[4] which suggested that pirfenidone may reduce the FVC decline associated with IPF and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Some of the data was conflicting from these earlier studies and thus the FDA required an additional phase 3 study.[5],/wiki/ASCEND_(IPF),,
Among patients with an unprovoked VTE who have completed anticoagulation therapy does aspirin reduce recurrent VTE?,The risk of recurrent VTE following completion of treatment for an unprovoked event is approximately 10% within the first year following the discontinuation of anticoagulation. Several studies including WARFASA (2012) AMPLIFY-EXT (2013) and ASPIRE have studied the benefits of continuation of aspirin or lower-dose anticoagulant in this setting.,/wiki/ASPIRE,,
Among healthy community-dwelling seniors does low-dose aspirin reduce death dementia or persistent physical disability when compared with placebo?,Trials like ISIS-2 (1988) solidified the role of aspirin in secondary prevention of CVD. The role of aspirin in primary prevention is less clear especially among low-risk elderly adults. In this population the bleeding risk from aspirin may outweigh the benefit from CVD risk reduction. As a reflection of the uncertain benefit of aspirin in seniors the 2016 USPSTF guidelines were unable to give a recommendation on the use of aspirin among adults age ≥70 years.[1],/wiki/ASPREE,,
Among patients with renal artery stenosis not clearly requiring revascularization how well does endovascular revascularization preserve renal function when compared to medical therapy alone?,Renal artery stenosis (RAS) often results in progressive renal dysfunction. No large trial had demonstrated efficacy of revascularization plus medical therapy to medical therapy alone in prevention of this outcome.,/wiki/ASTRAL,,
In patients with severe vasodilatory shock requiring high-dose catecholamines does angiotensin II result in improvement in mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared to placebo?,Shock is defined as any process resulting in insufficient blood pressure to provide adequate organ perfusion. The most common form of shock is vasodilatory shock commonly defined as shock in the setting of peripheral vasodilation and intact cardiac output. In addition to treating the underlying cause of vasodilatory shock catecholamine (e.g. dopamine norepinephrine epinephrine) and non-catecholamine (e.g. vasopressin) vasopressors are agents that combat vasodilatory shock by inducing peripheral vasoconstriction. However these agents are not uniformly effective in reversing vasodilatory shock and their use is associated with significant side effects including limb ischemia and cardiac arrhythmia. These difficulties are reflected in the fact that patients with vasodilatory shock requiring high-dose vasopressors have a mortality rate approaching 50% at 1 month. [1],/wiki/ATHOS-3,,
Among women with breast cancer how does 10 years of adjuvant tamoxifen compare to 5 years of tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality?,Two or five years of adjuvant tamoxifen had been the standard of care among women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Whether extension of therapy to 10 years or beyond results in improved efficacy and an acceptable side effect profile was and remains incompletely understood.,/wiki/ATLAS,,
In patients with recent ACS does the addition of rivaroxaban to standard dual antiplatelet therapy improve CV morbidity and mortality?,Two meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the addition of warfarin to aspirin among ACS patients suggested that combination therapy may reduce the risk of ischemic events.  However this was partially offset by an increased risk of bleeding compared to monotherapy.[1][2],/wiki/ATLAS_ACS-2,_TIMI_51,
In critically ill patients with acute tubular necrosis does more intensive renal replacement therapy decrease the risk of death at 60 days compared to conventional less-intensive renal replacement therapy?,Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) occurs in a significant minority (5-10%) of medical and surgical ICU patients and is associated with a mortality of ≥50%. While the standard of care for severe ATN includes renal replacement therapy (RRT) the optimal intensity of therapy has been controversial. Several single-center studies had suggested that mortality was improved with more intensive RRT programs but this was not consistently seen.[1][2] A large prospective randomized study was needed.,/wiki/ATN,,
In patients with cardiac amyloidosis does the amyloid protein stabilizer tafamidis reduce mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization at 30 months compared to placebo?,Cardiac amyloidosis is increasingly recognized as a common etiology of infiltrative cardiomyopathy particularly in patients of advanced age. Cardiac amyloidosis results from the deposition of abnormal misfolded proteins (amyloid) in the myocardium typically resulting in impaired cardiac systolic and diastolic function and conduction system disease. Transthyretin (TTR) cardiac amyloidosis is the most common form of cardiac amyloidosis and typically results from deposition of TTR a small protein produced by the liver that transports thyroxine and retinol-binding protein-retinol complex. TTR cardiac amyloidosis is typically encountered in two forms: (1) a familial form in which pathogenic mutations in TTR result in a predisposition to amyloid formation (termed mutated or mTTR amyloidosis) and (2) a sporadic form in which genetically normal TTR forms amyloid for unclear reasons (termed wild-type TTR).,/wiki/ATTR-ACT,,
In patients with proximal LE deep-vein thrombosis does pharmaco-mechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome?,Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic and potentially debilitating complication of DVT characterized by chronic swelling and pain and occasionally ulcers due to venous insufficiency.[1] Approximately 50% of patients with a DVT develop some degree of PTS and up to 10% will develop severe PTS.[2] This syndrome is the result of chronic venous hypertension from inflammatory-mediated damage to the venous walls and valves in the weeks to months following development of a thrombus.[1] As there is a general lack of effective treatments for PTS recent efforts have focused on prevention of the condition through accelerating resolution of the thrombus. Interventions like tPA/thrombolytics at time of acute DVT diagnosis may dissolve some or most of the clot and reduce the duration and severity of DVT-related inflammation which may in turn reduce the risk of PTS development. The CaVenT study[3] assessed catheter-directed tPA among ~200 patients with an acute iliofemoral DVT with symptoms starting in the prior 21 days. Compared to standard anticoagulation tPA was associated with a modest 14% reduction in PTS at 24 months (55% vs. 41%). Validation of these findings in a larger group plus understanding the utility of mechanical thrombus removal and stent placement was needed.,/wiki/ATTRACT,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is oral anticoagulation with apixaban superior to warfarin with regard to thrombotic events and bleeding? Is the addition of aspirin to oral anticoagulation and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy superior to placebo with regard to thrombotic events and bleeding?,The optimal anticoagulation/antiplatelet strategy following acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is unclear and has been the subject of intense study. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) has been established as standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF. Similarly P2Y12 inhibitors are used uniformly after ACS with or without PCI to prevent recurrent thrombosis (particularly stent thrombosis in the case of PCI). Whether anticoagulation with direct-acting oral factor Xa inhibitors (DOAC) is superior to warfarin in the post-PCI setting and whether the addition of aspirin to OAC and P2Y12 inhibition provides superior thrombotic protection are unclear. ,/wiki/AUGUSTUS,,
Among patients with ESRD on HD does rosuvastatin reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events when compared to placebo?,Adults with CKD experience a greater burden of CVD events that worsens with each successive stage of CKD.[1] As such those with ESRD on HD experience an incidence of 11 events/100 P-Y[2] a 10-30x increase in risk compared to the general population.[1] Identifying strategies to reduce the burden of CVD among ESRD is essential. ,/wiki/AURORA,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation thought to be unsuitable for anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist does apixaban reduce risk for stroke or systemic embolism when compared to aspirin? Also how does apixaban compare to aspirin rates of major bleeding?,The 1991 SPAF study[1] demonstrated the superiority of Vitamin K antagonist (VKA i.e. warfarin) therapy over aspirin in prevention of stroke in patients with AF. While prophylaxis with aspirin 81-325 mg is recommended as an alternative for low risk patients VKA therapy is the standard of care for those with a >1 moderate risk factor and no contraindications to the therapy.[2] VKA therapy presents multiple challenges including increased rate of bleeding drug-drug interactions and need for frequent monitoring. ACTIVE A (2009) compared the alternative regimen of aspirin plus clopidogrel to aspirin alone in patients with AF thought to be unsuitable for VKA therapy. Dual therapy decreased rates of major vascular events at cost of increased major bleeding. ,/wiki/AVERROES,,
In ambulatory patients with cancer who are initiating chemotherapy and who are at intermediate-to-high risk for venous thromboembolism does apixaban reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism?,Patients with active cancer have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) but determining who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis has been difficult especially given the burdensome and costly nature of parenteral therapy. Low-molecular-weight heparin has been studied for thromboprophylaxis for cancer patients but its efficacy is not well established.[1] Recent studies have investigated the use of oral factor Xa inhibitors in treatment of acute cancer-associated VTE (e.g. edoxaban in the Hokusai VTE Cancer Trial and rivaroxaban in SELECT-D). The role of these agents for primary prevention in high-risk adults is unknown. ,/wiki/AVERT,,
In patients who are having a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who are not hypoxic does supplemental oxygen worsen myocardial infarction size?,Supplemental oxygen for STEMI has been a long-standing accepted practice. Despite this there has been little in the way of data regarding supplemental oxygen in non-hypoxic patients.  While supplemental oxygen may improve oxygen delivery to ischemic tissue some studies have suggested a deleterious effect of oxygen in these non-hypoxic patients due to multiple physiologic mechanisms. Increased coronary vascular resistance can lead to reduced coronary blood flow. Formation of reactive oxygen species which can lead to worsening reperfusion injury.[1][2] However the clinical data behind this physiologic mechanism is minimal. A Cochran Review of three randomized trials looking at overall survival of patients with MI who received supplemental oxygen versus air did not show any statistical significant difference between the two but there was concern that due to there only being a small number of deaths the studies and subsequent meta-analysis were underpowered.[3] The 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend oxygen administration for patients with an oxygen saturation <90% respiratory distress or other high-risk features of hypoxia.[4] However there have not been any recommendations regarding non-hypoxic STEMI patients.,/wiki/AVOID,,
Among patients with HIV/AIDS does therapy with zidovudine reduce mortality when compared to placebo?,Given the high mortality with HIV/AIDS and lack of an effective therapy much effort went into identifying a potentially effective antiretroviral therapy in the 1980s. The nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine (ZDV; formerly azidothymidine or AZT) halts HIV replication through termination of viral DNA-chain elongation. It showed promise as the first antiretroviral medication for use in HIV/AIDS. A clinical trial demonstrating its effectiveness was lacking.,/wiki/AZT_Trial,,
Among patients with HFrEF (LVEF <40% in prior year) on a stable dose of a beta-blocker as an outpatient admitted for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) does cessation of that beta-blocker change feelings of wellbeing or dyspnea at 3 days?,There has been much clinical uncertainty in the continuation of beta-blocker therapy during ADHF hospitalizations in HFrEF.[1] Beta-blockers have a negative inotropic effect and decreases cardiac output and increases left ventricular filling pressures potentially acutely worsening the physiology leading to ADHF. In chronic HFrEF there is a clear benefit for the use of beta-blockers as has been shown in trials like MERIT-HF (1999) and COPERNICUS (2002). Observational studies have suggested a benefit for continuing beta-blockers during hospitalizations for ADHF in HFrEF however there was no RCT evidence supporting this practice.[2][3],/wiki/B-CONVINCED,,
Among patients with T2DM and stable CAD how does revascularization with either CABG or PCI compare to OMT in reducing CV events and death?,Revascularization with either CABG or PCI is recommended in patients with stable CAD and persistent angina refractory to OMT. The optimal revascularization strategy for stable CAD in diabetic patients whom are more likely to have diffuse multivessel disease had not yet been studied rigorously. COURAGE (2007) demonstrated no difference between PCI and OMT although only 32% were diabetic and CABG candidates were excluded.  A post hoc subgroup analysis of the BARI study (1996)[1] suggested that CABG improved survival compared to PCI among diabetic patients. However a direct comparison of revascularization strategies had not yet been undertaken among diabetics with stable CAD.,/wiki/BARI_2D,,
Among patients with mild to moderate asthma what is the comparative effect on disease outcomes when inhaled corticosteroids are adjusted based on physician assessment biomarkers or patient symptoms?,Physician assessment-based adjustment (PABA) strategies are the standard of care for controlling symptoms and exacerbations of asthma. Adjustment of medications based on objective data (eg exhaled nitric oxide) or symptoms may be easier although whether these approaches were as effective as PABA was unknown since large controlled trials were lacking. Symptom-based administration of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may provide benefit over traditional scheduled administration as it may improve patient adherence through increased motivation and reduce costs of care.[1],/wiki/BASALT,,
Among non-diabetic patients with advanced (stage 4) CKD does benazepril slow renal disease progression?,Blood pressure reduction improves cardiovascular outcomes and may reduce progression of kidney disease in patients with CKD especially those with albuminuria. Furthermore several subgroup and post-hoc analyses suggest that treatment with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB compared to other BP-lowering agents may further reduce kidney disease progression when albuminuria is present (AASK HOPE CASE J TRANSCEND). Most of these studies did not include patients with advanced CKD leading to uncertainty in whether the same treatment guidelines should be applied to these patients. Some practitioners also feared that further GFR reduction from RAAS blockade would reduce residual renal function and possibly accelerate renal deterioration[1]. While evidence from other trials (RENAAL REIN) suggested evidence to the contrary a trial investigating the role of ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs in patients with advanced CKD for prevention of renal function deterioration was needed.,/wiki/Benazepril_in_Severe_CKD,,
In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis which treatment strategies best prevent joint damage and functional decline?,Initial combination therapy with DMARD plus prednisone or infliximab results in improved functional recovery and less radiographic decline at one year as compared to sequential monotherapy or step-up combination therapy. While compelling the BeSt study arguably did not demonstrate the best therapeutic strategies for RA but does offer some that are better than others. A 2012 AHRQ comparative effectiveness review found no clear evidence supporting one therapy over another for RA treatment in adults.[1],/wiki/BeSt,,
In patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing revascularization is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with 2nd-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) noninferior to CABG with regard to death MI or target-vessel revascularization?,While the standard of care for patients presenting with symptomatic CAD attributable to multivessel (critical stenosis in ≥ 2 vessels) atherosclerosis has been surgical revascularization with CABG (also a class I indication in current consensus guidelines) this practice has been largely based on older RCT data using bare-metal stents or 1st generation DES which are known to be associated with a higher thrombosis rate than current 2nd-generation DES. Furthermore the 2012 SYNTAX trial demonstrated that the benefit of CABG over PCI appears to depend on anatomic complexity. As a result a contemporary comparison of PCI with CABG using contemporary 2nd-generation DES across the spectrum of anatomic complexity in multivessel CAD was needed.,/wiki/BEST,,
In acutely ill patients in the intensive care unit with severe metabolic acidosis does treatment with sodium bicarbonate reduce all-cause mortality at day 28 or the presence of ≥1 organ failure at day 7?,Severe metabolic acidosis carries a poor prognosis among ICU patients. Sodium bicarbonate may correct this derangement but the use of this medication has not been evaluated in a large prospective study. While bicarbonate may increase the pH its administration may contribute to volume overload decrease serum calcium increase lactate levels and increase PaCO2.[1] This may in turn worsen intracellular pH as CO2 is able to diffuse across cell membranes. ,/wiki/BICAR-ICU,,
In patients with high grade atrioventricular block and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (NYHA class I-III LVEF ≤ 50%) does biventricular pacing reduce death urgent heart failure care and adverse left ventricular remodeling compared to right ventricular pacing?,In patients with high-grade sinoatrial (SA) or atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction cardiac pacing is the primary treatment modality. Multiple RCTs in recent years including the MOST DAVID and Yu et al. 2009 [1]  trials have demonstrated the deleterious effects of right ventricular (RV) pacing on cardiac function in patients with heart failure and AV block. Conventional right ventricular apical pacing has been shown to result in worsening left ventricular (LV) function in a subset of patients due to non-physiological myocardial activation leading to ventricular dyssynchrony. It is thought that ventricular dyssynchrony results in maladaptive electrical metabolic and mechanical remodeling of the LV leading to impaired contractility [2]. As an alternative synchronously pacing both ventricles with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to mitigate ventricular dyssynchrony and improve clinical outcomes. CRT devices however are more technically challenging to place and are associated with higher costs and complication rates. ,/wiki/BLOCK-HF,,
In non-hispanic black men with uncontrolled hypertension is community-based (barbershop targeted) pharmacist-directed intervention superior to health promotion alone in reducing blood pressure?,Non-hispanic black men have the highest rate of hypertension-related death of any racial ethnic or sex group in the United States. [1] There is evidence to suggest that this observation is related to lower rates of physician interaction and hypertension treatment observed within this population. [2] As a result there has been considerable interest in the implementation and evaluation of interventions designed to bring healthcare providers to black men in the community. Community-based interventions targeting barbershops is a particular area of interest as at least one small study has shown modest but significant improvements in hypertension control when barbers checked blood pressure and urged patrons with elevated readings to make doctor appointments. [3] A limitation of this study is that even when patients sought medical attention upon the urging of their barbers treatment was often not escalated by their community providers. Thus it remained unclear whether a community-based intervention including the ability to initiate and uptitrate anti-hypertensive therapy in the community may result in more effective hypertension control.,/wiki/Blood_Pressure_Reduction_in_Black_Barbershops,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing an invasive procedure requiring interruption of warfarin therapy does bridging anticoagulation reduce rates of arterial thromboembolism compared to no bridging?,Randomized trials including SPAF and SPAF-II demonstrated a robust reduction in arterial thromboembolic events with the use of warfarin anticoagulation in patients with AF. The subsequent development of risk prediction models including CHADS2[1] and CHA2DS2-VASc[2] has allowed for the targeted use of therapeutic anticoagulation for those at higher risk for thromboembolic complications. As a result of these studies therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin has become standard of care for the vast majority of patients with AF.,/wiki/BRIDGE,,
In patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation does vemurafenib improve overall and progression-free survival compared to dacarbazine?,Metastatic melanoma carries a poor prognosis with conventional therapies including dacarbazine and interleukin-2. The finding that some half of patients with melanoma harbor a BRAF V600 mutation which drives their disease led to the development of BRAF inhibitors including vemurafenib and dabrafenib. ,/wiki/BRIM-3,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) requiring treatment is catheter ablation superior to medical therapy with regard to death disabling stroke serious bleeding or cardiac arrest?,Catheter ablation is an increasingly common strategy for achieving durable rhythm control in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). Two landmark randomized controlled trials (CASTLE-AF and AATAC) have established the safety and efficacy of AF ablation in patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure in which restoration of sinus rhythm is particularly desirable. In both of these trials AF ablation (when compared to medical therapy) not only improved quality of life and functional status but also had salutary effects on overall mortality and heart failure hospitalization. Whether AF ablation has similar benefit in the general population of AF patients requiring therapy (e.g. symptoms rapid rates) remains unclear.,/wiki/CABANA,,
In patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis does treatment with methotrexate guided by a strict step-wise computerised protocol improve disease remission in comparison to standard care? ,Aggressive treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is thought to prevent decline in long-term functional status through prevention of joint damage.[1] The use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) early in disease onset was thought to lead to higher rates of clinical remission. Particularly the 2004 TICORA study published demonstrated that monthly follow up visits with step-wise treatment using a predefined protocol guided by a composite disease activity score (DAS28) significantly improved remission rates and disease score compared to standard care with follow up visits every three months and treatment guided by clinical opinion. Whether a more regimented computer-assisted protocol could improve disease remission rates was unknown. Further TICORA employed glucocorticoids as the backbone therapy. The use of a methotrexate backbone was unknown. ,/wiki/CAMERA,,
Among patients with seasonal affective disorder how does light therapy compare with fluoxetine for clinical response and remission rates?,Trials in the late 1990s demonstrated the efficacy of light therapy in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD).[1][2] Large head-to-head comparisons of light therapy versus antidepressants were lacking.,/wiki/Can-SAD,,
Among patients with minor head trauma is it possible to develop a sensitive and specific tool to determine the necessity of CT head imaging?,Many experts rely on clinical gestalt to identify patients at high risk who should undergo head CT imaging for trauma. The Canadian rules were designed to identify a set of objective criteria for determining whether trauma patients are likely to require neurological intervention or have clinically important brain injury. The rule identifies two sets of criteria one for high-risk patients and the other for low-risk patients. The first a set of high-risk criteria identifies with 100% sensitivity (95% CI 0.92-1.00) patients at risk for emergent neurological intervention when any of the following are present:,/wiki/Canadian_CT_Head_Rule,,
Among patients with a history of myocardial infarction and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of ≥ 2mg/L does treatment with canakinumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β) reduce the rate of recurrent cardiovascular events when compared with placebo?,The inflammatory hypothesis posits that inflammation mediates the development of atherosclerotic plaque and its progression to myocardial infarction.[1] The role of inflammation in atherosclerosis is supported by previous data demonstrating higher incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with higher levels of inflammatory markers.[2][3] No evidence to date has demonstrated effective prevention of cardiovascular events with antiinflammatory therapy independent of lipid-lowering effects.,/wiki/CANTOS,,
Among patients with T2DM at high risk for CV events does daily canagliflozin reduce CV mortality nonfatal MI or nonfatal strokes when compared to placebo?,Mortality in T2DM is mainly related to an increased incidence of CV disease.[1] While standard medications such as insulin sulphonylureas and DPP4 inhibitors all effectively reduce blood glucose these agents have not been associated with improvements in a cardiovascular disease or survival.  The thiazolidinedione pioglitazone in PROactive (2005) and the DDP4 inhibitors alogliptin in EXAMINE (2013) and saxagliptin in SAVOR-TIMI 53 (2013)[2] and TECOS (2015)[3] have all failed to demonstrate cardiovascular benefits or improved survival in this patient population. ,/wiki/CANVAS,,
In patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to non-intensive care unit (ICU) wards is beta-lactam monotherapy noninferior to quinolone therapy or combination beta-lactam plus macrolide?,Current US guidelines for CAP in a non-ICU setting recommend that inpatient treatment include coverage with either a macrolide plus a beta-lactam or a fluoroquinolone for empiric therapy. The evidence supporting this is limited and in fact many European countries have guidelines that support beta-lactam monotherapy as the initial choice. ,/wiki/CAP-START,,
Among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% does treatment with carvedilol improve mortality? ,Beta-blockers have been used extensively for many decades in the acute and long-term treatment of MI based on RCTs conducted prior to the advent of reperfusion therapies and ACE inhibitors [1][2][3]. However in these studies patients with heart failure were largely excluded. Prior to the publication of CAPRICORN there were no large-scale RCTs investigating the effect of beta-blockers in patients that develop LV systolic dysfunction post-MI. The MERIT-HF COPERNICUS and CIBIS-II trials all showed a mortality benefit with beta-blockers in patients with HFrEF. However in all these trials recent MI was an exclusion criteria. Furthermore in the era of ACE inhibitor use post-MI it was not known if beta-blockers would confer additional benefit when added to ACE inhibitors in patients with MI and reduced LV function. CAPRICORN was the first and only large-scale RCT investigating the effect of beta blockers in patients with acute MI and reduced LV function (with or without heart failure) in the era of reperfusion and ACE inhibition. ,/wiki/CAPRICORN,,
In patients with a recent CV event (stroke or MI) how does clopidogrel compare to aspirin in the secondary prevention of stroke MI and CV death?,Prior placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that aspirin and ticlopidine independently reduce risk of stroke MI and CV death with head-to-head studies demonstrating a slight advantage of ticlopidine. CAPRIE sought to evaluate whether clopidogrel a thienopyridine like ticlopidine would compare favorably to aspirin using similar outcome measures. In CAPRIE clopidogrel reduced the risk of CV events by 9% compared to aspirin without an adverse effect on bleeding events.,/wiki/CAPRIE,,
Is apixaban noninferior to dalteparin (LMWH) for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE)?,'Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been the mainstay treatment of VTE for patients with cancer[1] based in large part on the CLOT trial which demonstrated the superiority of LMWH to warfarin.[2] The advent of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) made them an attractive alternative in an effort to reduce patients'' injection burden. Previous studies demonstrated favorable outcomes with edoxaban in Hokusai-VTE and rivaroxaban in SELECT-D but randomized data with apixaban were lacking. ',/wiki/CARAVAGGIO,,
In patients with stable CAD undergoing major elective vascular surgery is there a mortality benefit in preoperative coronary artery revascularization?,Patients undergoing elective vascular surgery have a high prevalence of CAD and risk of peri-operative cardiac complications.[1][2] In such patients clinically significant CAD confers a significant in-hospital and 30-day cardiac mortality rate.[3][4] Prior to CARP patients with stable CAD often underwent prophylactic preoperative revascularization to lower the risk of cardiac complications when undergoing elective vascular surgery.,/wiki/CARP,,
In patients with acute decompensated heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome does ultrafiltration improve volume removal renal function and reduce HF complications when compared to medical therapy?,Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) but their use is associated with electrolyte abnormalities and renal dysfunction that have led investigators to study other methods of volume removal in ADHF.[1][2] FDA-approved ultrafiltration (UF) devices similar to dialysis machines allow direct removal of isotonic fluid directly from the bloodstream. This therapy has been thought by some to be the preferred method for volume removal in ADHF based on small trials.[1] The first large trial comparing UF to diuretic therapy in ADHF was UNLOAD (2007)[3] which demonstrated improved weight loss and fewer readmissions with UF although there was no difference in serum creatinine or length of stay when compared to standard diuretic therapy. Despite the promising results in UNLOAD the role of UF in ADHF complicated by cardiorenal syndrome was unclear until CARRESS-HF. ,/wiki/CARRESS-HF,,
In ambulatory patients with cancer at high risk for thromboembolism (Khorana score ≥2) is low-dose rivaroxaban more effective than placebo in reducing incidence of venous thromboembolic disease?,Patients with active cancer have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) but whether there are patients who benefit from anticoagulation to prevent VTE (thromboprophylaxis) is not clear. A few small trials have suggested benefit with use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) products in this setting but event rates were low and the absolute benefit was modest.[1][2] Furthermore LMWH products are injectable rather than oral which has limited widespread use for this indication. More recently risk stratification for incident VTE through the use of validated scores such as the Khorana score (scaled from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating a higher risk of venous thromboembolism) now facilitate identification of patients at higher risk for developing VTE and therefore more likely to benefit from thromboprophylaxis. [3] Furthermore direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have recently shown efficacy in VTE treatment even in patients with active malignancy (see Hokusai VTE Cancer Trial for edoxaban and SELECT-D for rivaroxaban). Whether DOACs may facilitate a more convenient and efficacious strategy for VTE prevention in cancer patients at particularly high risk of VTE remains unclear. ,/wiki/CASSINI,,
Among patients with recent MI and increased ventricular ectopy do antiarrhythmic agents improve survival?,The significance of post-MI ventricular ectopy depends on the timing of the arrhythmia following a myocardial infarction. NSVT within the first 24 hours of an infarction is probably related to reperfusion ischemia and is commonly felt to be less prognostic.  However data from the Multicenter Post-Infarction Program has demonstrated that NSVT found more than one week after an infarction carries a two-fold increased risk of sudden cardiac death with the greatest risk in the first 6 months.[1] In patients post-MI with LVEF≤40 the risk is increased more than five-fold. In the 1970-1980s studies attempted to assess whether suppression of ventricular ectopy could improve outcomes following MI but these were too small to be conclusive.  ,/wiki/CAST_I,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and symptomatic (NYHA II-IV) systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤ 35%) is catheter ablation superior to medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) with regard to death or hospitalization for heart failure?,AF is frequently comorbid with systolic heart failure and is associated with increased risk of stroke hospitalization for heart failure and death and this population.[1] The ideal management strategy for AF in the setting of significant systolic heart failure however remains unclear. Multiple RCTs including the landmark AFFIRM trial (2002) have demonstrated similar outcomes with a rate control strategy (i.e. use of AV nodal blockade to attain a safe heart rate with no intent to restore sinus rhythm) versus a rhythm control strategy (i.e. use of antiarrhythmic drugs [AAD] or procedures to restore and maintain sinus rhythm) in patients with AF. Nevertheless these initial trials included primarily older patients without structural heart disease and in particular patients with significant LV dysfunction were underrepresented. Furthermore patients with significant LV dysfunction often fail to tolerate the degree of AV nodal blockade required to maintain adequate rate control due to negative inotropic effects or are dependent on atrial contraction to maintain adequate forward flow. Finally the majority of these trials were performed prior to the emergence of catheter ablation for AF which has demonstrated good efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm and does not pose the same risk of long-term side effects as antiarrhythmic drugs (see FIRE and ICE 2016).,/wiki/CASTLE-AF,,
Among patients with schizophrenia how do the second-generation antipsychotic medications such as olanzapine quetiapine risperione and ziprasidone compare to first-generation antipsychotic medications such as perphenazine in terms of relative effectiveness?,The Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) schizophrenia trial compared the relative effectiveness of the second-generation antipsychotic medications (olanzapine risperidone quetiapine and ziprasidone) to the first-generation antipsychotic perphenazine. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation for any cause and remarkably only 26% of patients completed 18 months of the study drug to which they were randomized. Olanzapine was associated with a longer time to discontinuation than quetiapine or risperidone but was similar to perphenazine and ziprasidone.  Olanzapine was associated with greater weight gain hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia whereas ziprasidone was associated with weight loss and improvement in lipids and in blood glucose.  ,/wiki/CATIE,,
Among patients with Alzheimer disease do atypical antipsychotics reduce the behavioral symptoms of psychosis aggression or agitation?,Most patients with Alzheimer disease will develop psychosis aggression or agitation at some time during their care and even despite a dearth of data these behaviors had commonly been treated with antipsychotic agents. Mounting evidence that antipsychotics were associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events including stroke and death prompted a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotics for the treatment of psychosis aggression or agitation among patients with Alzheimer disease.,/wiki/CATIE-AD,,
Among patients with choroidal neovascularization from age-related macular degeneration does scheduled or as-needed administration of ranibizumab or bevacizumab result in equivalent changes in visual acuity at one year?,"Monthly intravitreal injection of the anti-VEGF medication ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis) was shown to be effective in improving visual acuity in choroidal neovascularization from age-related macular degeneration (""wet"" AMD) in the 2006 industry-sponsored MARINA study.[1] It received an indication for this from the FDA later that year. The related anti-VEGF medication bevacizumab (trade name Avastin) was being used off-label as a low-cost alternative to the ~$2000/dose ranibizumab. Both of these medications are manufactured by Genentech and were derived from the same murine monoclonal antibody.[2] Whether bevacizumab was non-inferior to ranibizumab and if they could be used in response to progression of neovascularization rather than on a fixed monthly schedule was unknown.

Among patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI does cangrelor reduce the risk of ischemic events as compared to clopidogrel?,The effectiveness of P2Y12-receptor antagonist (eg clopidogrel prasugrel ticagrelor) in ACS has been demonstrated in multiple trials including the CURE COMMIT TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO. Periprocedural administration of these oral agents can be challenging if there is significant nausea dysphagia or altered mental status. Cangrelor is an intravenous fast-acting (half-life 2.9-5.5 minutes) antiplatelet medication that has rapidly reversible inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor.[1] Its efficacy in PCI was unknown.,/wiki/CHAMPION_PHOENIX,,
Among patients with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke does the early administration of aspirin/clopidogrel reduce rates of subsequent strokes when compared to aspirin monotherapy?,The efficacy of single-agent antiplatelet therapy in patients with recent strokes was established by IST (1997; aspirin) and CAPRIE (1996; clopidogrel). A logical extension was that combination therapy with aspirin/clopidogrel may reduce the rate of subsequent stroke even further. This gave rise to MATCH (2004) which demonstrated that aspirin/clopidogrel reduced stroke rates to a similar degree as Plavix monotherapy and conferred an increased risk of bleeding. MATCH was criticized for including patients who would not likely have benefited from antiplatelet therapy as the majority of patients had lacunar infarcts rather than atherothrombotic events. Moreover the vast majority of antiplatelet trials in stroke have studied patients with recent stroke (ie <6 months) not patients in the acute stroke setting. Since a large number of subsequent strokes occur early CHANCE sought to bring dual antiplatelet therapy into the acute setting.,/wiki/CHANCE,,
Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events does combination aspirin plus clopidogrel therapy provide greater protection against cardiovascular events than aspirin alone?,Aspirin prevents some but certainly not all cardiovascular (CV) events among high-risk patients. CAPRIE and other trials demonstrated that the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel further reduced rates of CV events. Combination therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel has been used successfully in ACS in CURE CREDO CLARITY-TIMI and COMMIT. It was not known whether the benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy would extend to the non-ACS setting.,/wiki/CHARISMA,,
Among patients with symptomatic HFrEF on an ACE-inhibitor does the addition of candesartan reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization?,ACE-inhibitors became standard of care in HFrEF because of survival benefit in trials like CONSENSUS (1987) and SOLVD (1991). Likewise beta-blockers became standard of care following publication of CIBIS-II (1999) MERIT-HF (1999) and COPERNICUS (2002). The role of ARB add-on therapy to ACE-inhibitors was first explored in Val-HeFT (2001) which demonstrated benefit for a combined CV endpoint though it was driven primarily by a reduction in HF hospitalizations. Addition of ARBs led to higher rates of adverse events including renal dysfunction. Of note only 34% of patients were on beta blockers.,/wiki/CHARM-Added,,
In patients with HFpEF does candesartan reduce the rate of death or HF hospitalizations when compared to placebo?,Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains difficult to treat with limited data to suggest optimal treatment strategies. By comparison multiple landmark studies in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have demonstrated improved survival when ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been used to block the renin-angiotensin system. Examples of these studies include CONSENSUS (1987) SOLVD (1991) and CHARM-Alternative (2003). Whether the benefit of ARBs extended to patients with HFpEF has been unclear. Two main studies CHARM-Preserved and I-PRESERVE addressed this question.,/wiki/CHARM-Preserved,,
Among patients with advanced solid tumors what is the efficacy and tolerability of the anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab?,Patients with unresectable relapsed or metastatic solid tumors are usually treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and despite this their prognosis is generally poor. This poor prognosis relates to the inability to fully eradicate tumors in these settings which is driven in part by tumor evasion of the immune system. Early attempts to harness the immune system were modestly successful but only in specific malignancies; for example high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 appears to cure approximately 8% of selected patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.[1] With a growing understanding of immune checkpoint pathways[2] specific mechanisms by which tumors promote T-cell anergy were discovered; these include interactions with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) programmed death 1 (PD1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1). The monoclonal antibody ipilimumab was the first FDA-approved targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor and is currently indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma based on a phase 3 study published in 2010.[3],/wiki/CheckMate-003,,
Among females aged 14-19 years who had use of long-acting reversible contraception promoted and had free access to their contraception of choice what were the rates of pregnancy live birth and induced abortions when compared to national samples?,The pregnancy rate among women before the age of 20 is approximately 30%. This rate is higher among Black and Hispanic women (~40%) than White women (~20%). Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) therapies (IUDs and implants) are effective therapies for the prevention of unplanned pregnancies though they are underutilized by this demographic at least partially because of their cost and lack of access. Whether removing these barriers would reduce rates of pregnancy live birth or induced abortion was unknown.,/wiki/CHOICE,,
In patients with non-dialysis–dependent CKD and anemia how does erythropoetin treatment targeting a hemoglobin >13.5 g/dL compare with a hemoglobin >11.3 g/dL in reducing CV events including death MI hospitalizations for CHF and stroke?,The Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) trial randomized 1432 patients with non-dialysis–dependent CKD and anemia to achieve a target hemoglobin (Hgb) of either 13.5 or 11.3 g/dL.  CHOIR was terminated early because there was no evidence of CV benefit in the high-Hgb group.  In addition there were a higher number of events in the high-Hgb arm primarily due to nonsignificant trends towards a higher risk of death and of hospitalization for CHF.  Improvements in quality of life were similar in both arms.,/wiki/CHOIR,,
In patients with established atherosclerotic heart disease (previous MI or multivessel coronary disease plus either type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome) does low-dose methotrexate reduce cardiac events compared to placebo?,Inflammation has been shown to be a causal factor in the progression of atherosclerotic heart disease. In the CANTOS trial selective inhibition of Interleukin-1B a potent activator of innate immunity with the monoclonal antibody canakinumab led to a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients with a history of MI and residually elevated c-reactive protein without exerting significant effects on lipid levels or blood pressure. However widespread utilization of canakinumab remains limited by high cost and lack of experience with clinical use. In contrast methotrexate is a low-cost widely-utilized immunosuppressant with a long track record of safe use among patients with rheumatic disease representing a possible alternative method of achieving modulation of inflammation to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with established atherosclerotic heart disease.,/wiki/CIRT,,
In patients with cryptogenic stroke or TIA with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) does percutaneous PFO closure reduce the risk of a recurrent event?,Up to 50% of young patients with cryptogenic stroke have PFOs at autopsy. Thus the evaluation of cryptogenic stroke or TIA often includes echocardiography to identify a right-to-left intracardiac shunt. However PFOs and other atrial septal abnormalities are discovered incidentally among some 25% of the general population.[1] Based upon the French PFO-ASA and PICSS trials aspirin is the mainstay of medical therapy for individuals with cryptogenic stroke/TIA and PFO. Surgical closure of the defect however had been a subject of controversy particularly when evidence was sparse and PFO closure carried significant morbidity. With the advent of minimally invasive percutaneous PFO closure however investigators considered that the benefits of PFO closure may outweigh its risks among individuals with cryptogenic stroke/TIA.,/wiki/CLOSURE_I,,
In patients with cancer and acute symptomatic VTE how does LMWH compare with warfarin in preventing VTE recurrence?,Prior to the CLOT trial standard therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) consisted of a brief period of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by long-term oral anticoagulation. The 2003 Comparison of Low Molecular Weight Heparin Versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for Long Term Anticoagulation in Cancer Patients With Venous Thromboembolism (CLOT) trial demonstrated superiority of dalteparin (LMWH) over oral anticoagulants among patients with cancer.  Dalteparin was associated with a reduction in the rate of recurrent VTE at 6 months without any significant differences in the rate of bleeding or mortality as compared with warfarin. These findings were confirmed in the 2006 LITE[1] and ONCENOX[2] trials. ,/wiki/CLOT,,
In patients with moderate-severe or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to annular dilation in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (functional MR) and high surgical risk does percutaneous mitral valve repair with the Mitra Clip leaflet approximation device reduce heart failure hospitalization or mortality?,In patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) dilation of the mitral valve annulus commonly results in secondary or functional mitral regurgitation (MR). When functional MR becomes severe it leads to a dramatic increase in heart failure-related complications including hospitalization decreased quality of life and shortened survival.[1] Unfortunately treatment of functional MR in this setting is challenging as neither surgical repair or replacement has been shown to robustly improve symptoms or outcomes in this population.[2] Furthermore surgical risk is frequently very high since these patients frequently have severe heart failure. ,/wiki/COAPT,,
In patients with CAD requiring aspirin and clopidogrel what is the effect of omeprazole on GI and CV outcomes? ,The 2010 Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial (COGENT) randomized 3761 high-risk patients with ACS or undergoing PCI to omeprazole or placebo. The trial was stopped early because of cessation of sponsor funding.[1] It demonstrated a 66% reduction in the primary GI endpoint which was a composite of overt and occult GI bleed symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosive disease at 180 days. In particular there was an 87% reduction in overt upper GI bleeding. The NNT to prevent one overt GI bleed was 90. Despite previous observational studies raising concerns that PPIs may inhibit the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel COGENT demonstrated no such impact of omeprazole on cardiovascular outcomes or cardiovascular mortality reassuring the safety of omeprazole in combination with clopidogrel.,/wiki/COGENT,,
In patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in the last 30 days does colchicine reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events versus placebo?,Recent evidence has confirmed a critical role for inflammation in the process of atherosclerotic heart disease. The recent CANTOS study was the first large cardiovascular outcomes trial to demonstrate a role for immunomodulation in reducing cardiovascular events. In CANTOS treatment with the IL-1B inhibitor canakinumab resulted in a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular events when compared to placebo in individuals with established atherosclerotic heart disease. However uptake of canakinumab has been limited due to a slightly higher incidence of severe infections presumably related to potent immunosuppression. Shortly after CANTOS the CIRT trial showed no detectable benefit with the weaker immune modulator methotrexate in individuals with established cardiovascular disease. As a result identification of an effective immunosuppressant with a safer adverse effect profile with the potential to reduce cardiovascular events in individuals with residual inflammatory risk represents a major unmet need. ,/wiki/COLCOT,,
In asymptomatic adults age 50-69 is fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) every 2 years noninferior to colonoscopy in terms of reduction of colorectal cancer mortality? ,FIT every 1-2 years is the predominant method of colorectal cancer screening in Europe whereas colonoscopy every 10 years is the predominant screening method in the United States. There is a substantial difference in both cost and patient compliance between these methods yet there is no conclusive evidence as to which is more effective at reducing mortality.,/wiki/COLONPREV,,
In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II-IV symptoms how does carvedilol compare with metoprolol tartrate in improving survival?,The 2003 Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) randomized 3029 patients with class II-IV heart failure to carvedilol or metoprolol twice daily in addition to other medical therapies. With a mean follow-up of 4.8 years the carvedilol group outperformed the metoprolol tartrate group in all-cause mortality (34% vs. 40%; P=0.0017).,/wiki/COMET,,
Among patients with acute MI who are not undergoing PCI does metoprolol reduce rates of death reinfarction or cardiac arrest? ,Published in 2005 the Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial/Second Chinese Cardiac Study (COMMIT/CCS-2) randomized 45952 patients in China with acute MI to metoprolol or placebo at initial presentation. The majority of patients had STEMI or LBBB (93%) and about half underwent fibrinolysis; patients scheduled for PCI were excluded. Patients were given IV metoprolol followed by moderate/high-dose oral metoprolol. At 28 days there were no differences in the co-primary outcomes of death (7.7% vs. 7.8%) or the composite outcome of death reinfarction or cardiac arrest (9.4% vs. 9.9%) but metoprolol increased rates of cardiogenic shock (5.0% vs. 3.9%) and shock-related mortality (2.2% vs. 1.7%). A post hoc subgroup analysis identified Killip class ≥2 as a predictor of the development of cardiogenic shock and suggested that those with less severe disease may receive a marginal benefit from beta-blockade.,/wiki/COMMIT,,
In patients with multivessel coronary disease presenting with ST elevation MI (STEMI) is complete revascularization using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) guidance superior to infarct-related artery (IRA) only PCI with regard to major cardiovascular adverse events (death MI revascularization stroke)?,PCI is standard of care for STEMI and treatment of the infarct-related artery (IRA) has an established mortality benefit in this disease. However up to 30% of patients presenting with STEMI are found to have multivessel CAD with significant stenosis seen in one or more non-infarct-related arteries (N-IRA). It is unclear whether these lesions are simply incidental in which the risks of intervening upon them after culprit vessel revascularization may outweigh the benefits or whether these N-IRA lesions contribute to a pro-thrombotic milieu for which intervention may reduce the risk of recurrent events. Older observational and registry studies suggest that multivessel revascularization either at the time of index PCI or within a short interval lead to either similar or worse outcomes. [1][2] However these retrospective analyses are limited by confounding as sicker patients may be more likely to undergo more aggressive intervention at the time of PCI. In addition PCI technology has improved significantly since the time of these analyses and thus the risk profile of more complex intervention may be lower than previously suggested.,/wiki/Compare-Acute,,
In patients with established stable atherosclerotic disease is rivaroxaban plus aspirin more effective than aspirin alone in reducing cardiovascular death stroke or nonfatal MI?,Despite effective secondary prevention strategies in patients with established stable atherosclerotic disease the risk of recurrent events remains in the range of 5-10% per year. Previous studies investigating whether therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin in addition to standard-of-care low-dose aspirin have largely demonstrated modestly improved event rates but with substantially increased risk of bleeding (including intracranial bleeding).[1] Whether the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (e.g. rivaroxaban) which demonstrate similar antithrombotic efficacy as warfarin but with lower risk of bleeding may provide a safer means of more effective thrombotic protection is unclear. Furthermore the ATLAS ACS-2 TIMI 51 trial demonstrated that in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome low-dose rivaroxaban in addition to background dual-antiplatelet therapy reduced recurrent thrombosis rates without increasing bleeding rates. However the ATLAS trial has been criticized for missing data leading to uncertainty regarding its results. A randomized trial of rivaroxaban in addition to aspirin in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease was needed.,/wiki/COMPASS,,
In patients with severe HFrEF and NYHA class IV symptoms does enalapril improve survival?,The treatment of heart failure up until the 1980s focused primarily on symptom control through use of diuretics and digoxin. The effect of the newer class of ACE inhibitors on heart failure was not well understood.,/wiki/CONSENSUS,,
In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class III-IV symptoms does carvedilol improve survival?,The role of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic compensated HFrEF has been well established in trials like CIBIS-II[1] (1999) and MERIT-HF (1999). The role of beta-blocker use in patients with severely reduced EF was unclear.,/wiki/COPERNICUS,,
Among patients with hypertension or chronic kidney disease secondary to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis does renal artery stenting improve renal and/or cardiac outcomes?,Symptomatic renal artery stenosis (RAS) can lead to severe or resistant hypertension ischemic nephropathy recurrent flash pulmonary edema and refractory heart failure. While control of blood pressure in renovascular disease with antihypertensive medications is the mainstay of therapy percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with stenting has become an increasingly common procedure performed in patients refractory to medical management alone.,/wiki/CORAL,,
Do statins improve survival in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy?,Cardiomyopathies are broadly classified as ischemic and non-ischemic the former a consequence of coronary atherosclerosis. Consequently a majority of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy receive statins as a part of their HF regimen. The observation that most patients with moderate-severe HFrEF die of progressive HF rather than ACS or other CV events led to the hypothesis that statins may not improve survival among this population. GISSI-HF studied this hypothesis among ischemic and non-ischemic HF patients while CORONA investigated ischemic HF patients only.,/wiki/CORONA,,
Among critically ill patients in septic shock does low-dose hydrocortisone therapy improve survival?,Prior studies such as the smaller Annane Trial (2002) had suggested a survival benefit associated with the administration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency (cortisol rise <9 mcg/dL after ACTH stimulation test). As a result corticosteroids remained standard of care for decades among such patients. Subsequent studies failed to duplicate the benefits seen in the Annane Trial and even suggested infection-related harm associated with routine corticosteroid use. Thus the role of corticosteroids in septic shock remained unclear.,/wiki/CORTICUS,,
In patients with stable CAD how does optimal medical therapy plus PCI compare to optimal medical therapy alone in improving survival?,The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial randomly assigned ~2300 patients with stable CAD to either optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone or OMT plus PCI.  All patients received anti-ischemic therapy with ß-blockers calcium channel blockers and nitrates; antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and/or clopidogrel; and lipid-lowering statin therapy.  The majority of patients in the PCI arm received bare metal stents because drug-eluting stents were not yet approved for use until the final 6 months of the study period.  After a median follow-up of 4.6 years COURAGE demonstrated no significant differences between the two treatment strategies for the primary outcome of death from any cause and non-fatal MI.  There was also no significant difference in the rates of ACS hospitalizations between groups. Followup of the cohorts demonstrated that significantly more patients in the PCI arm were free of angina and had higher overall quality of life by 6 months but this benefit disappeared by 36 months likely reflecting the progression of underlying CAD. Fifteen-year follow-up data published in 2015 found no difference in mortality between the groups.[1],/wiki/COURAGE,,
Among older women residing in nursing homes does administration of cranberry capsules vs. placebo decrease bacteriuria plus pyuria?,Women aged ≥65 are at high risk for bacteriuria plus pyuria. The risk for these women is increased while living in a nursing home. Cranberry products have been used to decrease risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) but there is little clinical evidence to support this strategy. While UTI is a clinical diagnosis with variability based upon diagnostic approach bacteriuria and pyuria are objective findings thought to be on the causal pathway of UTI. Should cranberry capsules reduce incident pyuria and bacteriuria among high risk women this would potentially support its use in prevention of UTI. ,/wiki/Cranberry_for_prevention_of_pyuria_and_bacteriuria,,
Does tranexamic acid when given within 8 hours to patients with or at risk of significant bleeding reduce death within 4 weeks of injury?,Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death among patients with major trauma. Trauma leads to hemorrhage both from primary injury to organs and blood vessels but also to transient hyperfibrinolysis that is incompletely understood. Tranexamic acid a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine appears to interfere with this hyperfibrinolysis prompting investigators to study whether the agent may reduce the morbidity and mortality of traumatic hemorrhage. It has previously been used in controlling bleeding complications in those with hemophilia those undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and those with menorrhagia. ,/wiki/CRASH-2,,
In patients with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy characterized by albuminuria (ACR >300-5000 mg/g) and reduced GFR (30-90 mL/min/1.73m2 BSA) does canagliflozin 100mg/d reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and death from renal or cardiovascular disease compared to placebo?,Between 22 to 25 patients would need to be treated for approximately 2.5 years in order to prevent one occurrence of the primary composite outcome.,/wiki/CREDENCE,,
In patients with carotid artery stenosis how does carotid artery stenting compare with carotid endarterectomy in terms of stroke MI and death?,The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs. Stenting Trial (CREST) compared stenting to endarterectomy in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Prior studies demonstrated stenting as a valid alternative to CEA but yielded conflicting results and a large-scale comparison study had not yet been done. CREST was the largest such comparative study powered to more definitively answer the question of whether stenting or CEA should be the preferred revascularization strategy for patients with carotid stenosis.,/wiki/CREST,,
Among ICU patients with hypovolemic shock does fluid resuscitation with colloids reduce mortality at 28 days when compared to crystalloids? ,'Hypovolemic shock results in tissue hypoperfusion that may be life-threatening. Fluid resuscitation is the mainstay of therapy with crystalloids and colloids among the most commonly used fluid replacement types. Colloids like albumin dextrans and hydroxylethyl starches may selectively fill the intravascular space compared to crystalloids like normal saline and lactated Ringer''s solution which are more widely distributed in both intra- and extravascular fluid compartments. Evidence of a clinical benefit of colloids over crystalloids was lacking however. The 2004 SAFE trial found no benefit for albumin over normal saline for volume resuscitation in a diverse group of ICU patients. Whether colloids would benefit a more specific group of ICU patients with hypovolemic shock was unknown.',/wiki/CRISTAL,,
Among patients with T1DM nephropathy does addition of captopril reduce the creatinine doubling rate when compared to placebo?,Untreated diabetic nephropathy progresses to ESRD in most patients about 10 years after development of proteinuria. Furthermore those with proteinuria have nine times the risk of all-cause mortality than the general population.[1] Early aggressive treatment of concurrent hypertension in this condition was shown to decrease rate of decline of kidney function by Parving et al. in 1983.[2] No large study had been performed with ACE-inhibitors in this disease.,/wiki/CSG_Captopril_Trial,,
In patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by cardiogenic shock found to have multivessel CAD on angiography is multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) superior to culprit-only PCI?,"There has been substantial investigation into whether patients presenting with acute MI found to have multivessel obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography should undergo PCI of the culprit lesion only or complete revascularization. The previous DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI PRAMI and CvLPRIT trials have suggested that there may be benefit to complete revascularization with a meta-analysis of these trials demonstrating lower rates of composite major adverse cardiac events with complete revascularization. On the strength of these data the 2015 ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines on primary PCI for ST elevation MI now include PCI of non-culprit lesions in ""selected patients with STEMI and multivessel disease who are hemodynamically stable either at the time of primary PCI or as a planned staged procedure"" as a class IIb recommendation. Whether these findings extend to patients with severe enough MI to cause hemodynamic instability and cardiogenic shock is unclear and is of particular interest since patients with cardiogenic shock complicating MI are far more likely to have multivessel rather than single-vessel CAD.[1] In these cases it remains unknown whether the benefit of improved perfusion and myocardial function afforded by more complete revascularization is offset by the risks inherent to a longer procedure time increased contrast load and possible induction of further ischemia from complex intervention.",/wiki/CULPRIT-SHOCK,,
In adults admitted with community-acquired pneumonia what risk factors are associated with mortality and determine whether patients should be treated as an outpatient or inpatient?,Assessing the risk of CAP and determining whether patients should be treated as out- or inpatients was elusive until several studies demonstrated a method of classifying patients into severe disease. Yet prior to CURB-65 no study had studied the classification of patients into low-risk cohorts; ie those with mild disease that were suitable for outpatient management. Using a derivation cohort and validating it against a smaller cohort CURB-65 identified a 6-point system based on the presence of confusion urea >7 mmol/L (>20 mg/dl) respiratory rate ≥30/min low blood pressure (systolic <90 mmHg or diastolic ≤60 mmHg) and age ≥65 years. Scores of 0 to 1 were associated with low (<2%) 30-day mortality a score of 2 was associated with intermediate (9.2%) mortality and scores of ≥3 were associated with high (22%) mortality.,/wiki/CURB-65,,
In patients with UA/NSTEMI does the addition of clopidogrel reduce CV mortality MI or stroke?,Early trials such as the VA Cooperative Study (1983) and ISIS-2 (1988) demonstrated that aspirin which inhibits platelets through irreversible cyclooxygenase blockade decreases mortality in UA/NSTEMI. Clopidogrel a newer antiplatelet agent that irreversibly binds to the P2Y12 ADP receptors has been suggested to have better outcomes. CURE was designed to evaluate if clopidogrel would further improve outcomes from ACS when added to ASA.,/wiki/CURE,,
Among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and found to have multivessel disease on angiography is culprit lesion-only revascularization superior to complete revascularization with regard to a primary composite outcome of death nonfatal MI heart failure or repeat revascularization?,PCI is standard of care for STEMI and has an established mortality benefit in this disease. However up to 30% of patients presenting with STEMI are found to have multivessel CAD with significant stenosis seen in one or more non-infarct-related arteries (N-IRA). It is unclear whether these lesions are simply incidental in which the risks of intervening upon them after culprit vessel revascularization may outweigh the benefits or whether these N-IRA lesions contribute to a pro-thrombotic milieu in which intervention may reduce the risk of recurrent events. Older observational and registry studies suggest that multivessel revascularization either at the time of index PCI or within a short interval lead to either similar or worse outcomes. [1][2] However these retrospective analyses are limited by confounding as sicker patients may be more likely to undergo more aggressive intervention at the time of PCI. In addition PCI technology has improved significantly since the time of these analyses and thus the risk profile of more complex intervention may be lower than previously suggested.,/wiki/CvLPRIT,,
Among patients with newly-diagnosed ANCA-associated vasculitis with renal involvement is pulse cyclophosphamide superior to daily oral cyclophosphamide for the induction of remission?,ANCA-associated vasculitis was almost uniformly fatal until the introduction cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoid therapy was first demonstrated by Fauci and colleagues in the 1970s.[1] The optimal dosing of these medications was unclear. While several small studies suggested that pulse cyclophosphamide was likely equivalent to daily oral cyclophosphamide for the induction of remission in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis no large trial had been performed.,/wiki/CYCLOPS,,
Among patients with tobacco abuse is cytisine therapy noninferior to nicotine replacement therapy for abstinence at 1 month? ,Common therapies for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and the partial nicotinic ACh agonist varenicline (brand name Champix/Chantix). Cytisine is a generic plant-derived alkaloid that has a similar target to varenicline that is an over-the-counter smoking cessation aide used in Eastern Europe.[1] Its low cost makes it an attractive option for smoking cessation.

In adult patients with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera being treated with phlebotomy and/or hydroxyurea does intensive hematocrit lowering (target <45%) versus a less-intensive strategy (target 45-50%) reduce mortality from cardiovascular or major thrombotic events?,Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder (MPN) characterized by overproduction of erythrocytes — and to a lesser extent granulocytes and platelets — and is driven by a mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase in nearly all cases. PV is associated with arterial and venous thrombotic events related to increased blood viscosity. Lowering the hematocrit has long been shown to have beneficial effect but quantifying the benefit and establishing a therapeutic target has largely been based on observational data.[1]  In fact results from prior PV trials show mixed results of the influence of targeting a lower hematocrit on reducing thrombotic events.[2][3],/wiki/CYTO-PV,,
Among medical ICU patients on mechanical ventilation requiring continuous sedation do daily sedation holidays reduce days intubated in the ICU or in the hospital when compared to physician-guided sedation holidays?,'Continuous sedative infusions reduce anxiety decrease oxygen consumption and reduce nursing requirements among mechanically ventilated ICU patients. However there had been concerns that continuous sedation led to extended courses of mechanical intubation given the inability to assess patients'' overall mental capacity (including detection of new neurologic events) and potential for accumulation of sedatives.',/wiki/Daily_ICU_Sedation_Holidays,,
Among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) found to have multivessel disease on angiography is culprit lesion-only revascularization superior to fractional flow reserve (FFR) guided complete revascularization with regard to a primary composite outcome of death nonfatal MI or ischemia-driven revascularization?,PCI is standard of care for STEMI and treatment of the infarct-related artery (IRA) has an established mortality benefit in this disease. However up to 30% of patients presenting with STEMI are found to have multivessel CAD with significant stenosis seen in one or more non-infarct-related arteries (N-IRA). It is unclear whether these lesions are simply incidental in which the risks of intervening upon them after culprit vessel revascularization may outweigh the benefits or whether these N-IRA lesions contribute to a pro-thrombotic milieu for which intervention may reduce the risk of recurrent events. Older observational and registry studies suggested that multivessel revascularization either at the time of index PCI or within a short interval lead to either similar or worse outcomes. [1][2] However these retrospective analyses are limited by confounding as sicker patients may be more likely to undergo more aggressive intervention at the time of PCI. In addition PCI technology has improved significantly since the time of these analyses and thus the risk profile of more complex intervention may be lower than previously suggested.,/wiki/DANAMI-3_PRIMULTI,,
In patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ≤35% with symptomatic heart failure do implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) reduce overall mortality versus standard care?,On the strength of large RCTs including SCD-HeFT and MADIT-II demonstrating a clear mortality benefit ICD implantation carries a class I recommendation for patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy of any cause with LVEF ≤35% for the purposes of aborting sudden cardiac death.[1] The benefit of ICD implantation is generally considered to be similar in patients with non-ischemic vs. ischemic cardiomyopathy even though the majority of patients in SCD-HeFT and all of the patients in MADIT-II had cardiomyopathy with ischemic origin. Furthermore it is not clear that ICD implantation carries the same benefit in the heart failure population in the era of more frequent use of optimal medical therapy for heart failure and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with severe cardiomyopathy with significant conduction system disease.,/wiki/DANISH,,
In patients with or without type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease characterized by eGFR reduction and microalbuminuria does dapagliflozin affect the progression of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular death?,CKD is a risk factor for death among adults regardless of diabetes status.[1] Few options exist to prevent progression of CKD and reduce the risk of CKD-associated death. For example ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may prevent progression of progression to albuminuria but do not clearly alter changes in serum creatinine.[2] There is an urgent need to identify potential mechanisms to prevent progression of CKD. ,/wiki/DAPA-CKD,,
In individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA II-IV LVEF ≤40%) with or without diabetes does the addition of the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduce rates of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure?,In 2008 the US Food and Drug Administration began requiring every new drug for diabetes to be tested in a cardiovascular outcomes trial. Because of this the development of three new sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for diabetic patients was accompanied by three cardiovascular outcomes trials (CANVAS[1] EMPA-REG[2] and DECLARE-TIMI 58[3]). EMPA-REG and CANVAS showed reductions in composite primary outcomes of CV mortality nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke as well as reductions in HF hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. Though the mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit remains unclear it is likely to be driven by a reduction in HF death given that rates of MI were similar between treatment arms. In the more recent DECLARE-TIMI 58 study dapagliflozin did not show a statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome of major adverse CV events but did show a reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for HF. Prior studies were not powered to examine this class of medications in the setting of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).,/wiki/DAPA-HF,,
Among patients who have completed one year of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent PCI does continued DAPT reduce stent thrombosis and death MI or stroke without increasing bleeding?,Drug-eluting stents are intended to have lower rates of late restenosis than bare-metal stents through inhibition of neointimal proliferation.[1] However drug-eluting stents are at higher risk for in-stent thrombosis because of delayed endothelialization incomplete healing hypersensitivity and underlying atherosclerotic disease.[2][3][4] This risk is greatly reduced with DAPT typically with aspirin and a thienopyridine (eg clopidogrel). The 2011 ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines recommend 12 months of therapy[5] although the optimal duration is not known.,/wiki/DAPT,,
In patients with chronic HTN does a diet rich in fruits vegetables and low-fat dairy and low in saturated fats reduce blood pressure? ,Several trials have evaluated non-pharmacologic approaches to lowering BP including dietary and behavioral modifications.  For example TOMHS trial (1993)[1] evaluated a program of weight reduction sodium restriction and exercise.  The DASH trial (1997) evaluated a combination diet which is known today as the DASH diet and the DASH-sodium study (2001)[2] evaluated sodium restriction in addition to the DASH diet.  Most recently the PREMIER trial (2003)[3] also assessed the DASH diet with or without dietary/behavioral modification such as  weight loss physical activity and limitations in sodium and alcohol intake.,/wiki/DASH,,
In patients with an indication for an implantable defibrillator does obligate dual-chamber pacing improve mortality or hospitalization for heart failure compared to ventricular backup pacing?,"By the early 2000s on the strength of RCTs such as MADIT-II SCD-HeFT and AVID the indications for implantable defibrillators (ICDs) had expanded to include patients both with a history of significant ventricular arrhythmias as well as patients at high risk for developing them due to severe cardiomyopathy. In most of these studies the effectiveness of ICD therapy in reducing mortality was established using devices with a single lead in the right ventricle. Since these single-chamber ventricular devices cannot sense atrial activity pacing with these devices can result in simultaneous atrial and ventricular contraction leading to bothersome symptoms associated with backflow of blood from the atria (the pacemaker syndrome). As a result these devices were usually set to a ""backup only"" mode whereby pacing would only activate at very low heart rates. Furthermore out of fear of causing pacemaker syndrome by eliciting bradycardia patients with CHF often failed to receive optimal doses of beta-blocker and/or antiarrhythmic therapy. As a result there was a belief that routine placement of dual-chamber ICDs with the capability to provide synchronous atrial and ventricular pacing at a normal heart rate may allow these patients to tolerate more optimal medical therapy for HF with no risk of pacemaker syndrome.",/wiki/DAVID,,
Among patients with acute stroke between 6-24 hours of symptom onset does thrombectomy improve 90-day outcomes compared to standard care alone?,Several studies including MR CLEAN demonstrated the superiority of endovascular thrombectomy versus standard care alone among patients with acute stroke when performed within 6 hours of symptom onset. The benefits of the intervention declined as the time since onset increased.[1] However a subset of acute stroke patients have brain tissue that is ischemic but not yet infarcted; these patients have a clinical deficit that is disproportionately severe when compared to the amount of infarcted tissue on imaging. Among these patients there is currently limited evidence as to whether the ischemic tissue may be salvaged with reperfusion via thrombectomy. Therefore the purpose of this trial was to recruit patients with a mismatch between their clinical deficit and the volume of infarct on imaging studies.,/wiki/DAWN,,
In patients with T1DM how does strict glycemic control with intensive therapy compare with conventional therapy in preventing microvascular complications?,The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that strict glycemic control targeting lower HbA1c goals among patients with T1DM can both delay the onset of retinopathy nephropathy and neuropathy and slow the progression of existing microvascular complications. This came at the expense of a threefold higher risk of hypoglycemia underlying the fact that HbA1c goals should be tailored to the individual.,/wiki/DCCT,,
In patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and NYHA class II-IV symptoms what is the effect of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) on the risk of sudden death?,Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death among patients with symptomatic HF. Several trials including MADIT-I MADIT-II MUSTT and SCD-HeFT demonstrated a mortality benefit of prophylactic ICD placement in various patient groups including both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy.,/wiki/DEFINITE,,
In recently hospitalized elderly patients does ramelteon reduce the risk of delirium compared to placebo?,Delirium and other acute confusional states are common among hospitalized patients and older individuals are disproportionately affected. Because treatment is challenging and often ineffective the mainstay of management has been prevention. A 2007 Cochrane review[1] concluded that sparse evidence existed supporting any intervention to prevent delirium citing only early geriatric consultation as an evidence-based intervention in selected patients. There remains a sizable gap in the evidence for strategies that can prevent delirium.,/wiki/DELIRIA-J,,
Among patients with suspected myocardial infarction without hypoxemia did routine use of supplemental oxygen reduce all-cause mortality at 1 year when compared to ambient air?,The role of supplemental oxygen among adults with suspected acute MI without hypoxemia is uncertain and recent practice guidelines have highlighted a lack of evidence in its routine administration in MI.[1][2] Further a 2015 meta-analysis of oxygen use showed no significant difference with end points when comparing those randomized to high-concentration oxygen versus those randomized to titrated oxygen or room air in the setting of AMI [3] The 2017 AVOID trial of oxygen and acute myocardial infarction in normoxia suggested that patients with MI assigned to oxygen may have a larger infarct on a subset of patients who underwent cardiac MRI. However the role of oxygen among undifferentiated patients with findings concerning for MI was unclear. ,/wiki/DETO2X-AMI,,
Among patients with HFrEF does digoxin impact mortality or hospitalization rate compared to placebo?,Digoxin had been a mainstay of therapy for patients with HF and according to some epidemiologic studies was the most commonly prescribed agent for HF until fairly late in the 20th century. There was of course strong data demonstrating the mortality benefit of ACE inhibitors beta-blockers and other agents in HFrEF but little data supported a survival benefit to digoxin. The 1997 DIG trial sought to investigate whether digoxin improved survival or reduced hospitalizations among individuals with chronic compensated HFrEF. Digoxin reduced hospitalizations by 28% but had no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality. However a subgroup analysis of those with severe HFrEF had a trend towards a survival benefit.,/wiki/DIG,,
In patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤35%) and impaired autonomic function in the setting of acute MI does early prophylactic ICD placement decrease mortality compared to medical therapy alone?,Two large RCTs (MADIT-II and SCD-HeFT) have established the use of ICDs as primary prophylaxis for patients with LVEF ≤35%. However these trials were not designed to assess the role of ICD therapy in the immediate post-MI period when the risk of ventricular arrhythmia may be highest. In particular previous studies have demonstrated that patients with markers of impaired autonomic function suffer from increased mortality[1] suggesting that these patients are at especially high risk for sudden cardiac death.,/wiki/DINAMIT,,
In patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a saphenous vein graft do bare-metal stents (BMS) result in a higher rate of target-vessel failure compared to drug-eluting stents (DES)?,Multiple high quality randomized controlled trials (e.g. NORSTENT) have established drug-eluting stents (DES) as the standard of care for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in native coronary arteries. When compared to bare-metal stents (BMS) use of DES has been shown to result in lower rates of in-stent restenosis (ISR) as well as possibly stent thrombosis leading to fewer target-vessel failures over the long-term. Although the superiority of DES over BMS has been well-established for PCI involving native coronaries the comparative efficacy of DES over BMS has not been well-studied in PCI involving saphenous vein grafts an increasingly common procedure. Furthermore vein grafts typically allow for placement of stents with larger diameter which generally leads to lower ISR rates which may obviate the benefit of DES over BMS. Thus a randomized trial was needed to compare the performance of BMS versus DES in patients undergoing PCI of vein grafts.,/wiki/DIVA,,
Among patients with a first unprovoked VTE episode who have completed 3 months of anticoagulation does a D-dimer based anticoagulation cessation strategy result in favorable outcomes?,The D-dimer assay is an important component of the diagnostic workup of a patient with suspected VTE and it can also help estimate the risk of recurrent VTE in patients who have completed anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE. ,/wiki/DODS,,
In patients with end-stage heart or lung disease requiring transplantation who are negative for hepatitis C virus (HCV) does transplantation of an HCV positive organ with immediate anti-viral therapy result in similar allograft function and successful viral suppression compared to transplantation of HCV negative organs?,Mortality for patients with end-stage heart or lung disease awaiting transplantation remains a major public health problem. Many organs that are otherwise medically suitable for transplantation have traditionally been declined due to the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the donors. In the past transplantation of these HCV+ organs into HCV naive recipients has led to acquired chronic HCV infection in the vast majority of recipients.[1] Downstream effects of HCV acquisition have included increased mortality from liver disease and the development of accelerated graft damage due to cardiac allograft vasculopathy.[2],/wiki/DONATE-HCV,,
Among patients with acute decompensated HF how do continuous vs. intermittent and low- vs. high-dose IV loop diuretics compare in symptom improvement and impairment of renal function at 72 hours?,'Loop diuretics are central to the treatment of acute decompensated HF. Compared to intermittent boluses continuous infusions of loop diuretics achieve more constant plasma levels of diuretic which theoretically may protect against the adverse hemodynamic and renal effects of intermittent diuretic boluses. As a result continuous infusions became en vogue although no randomized trial had demonstrated the benefit of continuous infusions over intermittent boluses of diuretic.[1] The ideal dosage of loop diuretic also remains in question with some providers using double or triple a patient''s home dose and others preferring to start with the patient''s home dose and gradually uptitrating to achieve euvolemia.',/wiki/DOSE,,
In patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes do intensive lifestyle changes or metformin treatment prevent or delay the onset of diabetes?,Adults with prediabetes have a high incidence of developing overt T2DM. In the end of the 20th century there was little evidence to guide prevention of progression to T2DM among prediabetics. Given the high incidence of obesity and low levels of exercise among prediabetics and diabetics intensive lifestyle interventions promoting weight loss and exercise might be effective. Also metformin is an oral diabetes medication associated with weight loss and reduced gluconeogenesis. Whether intensive lifestyle it may prevent progression of prediabetes to T2DM was also unknown. ,/wiki/DPP,,
Among children with common warts does occlusive duct tape therapy result in improved wart resolution when compared to cryotherapy?,'The common wart occurs in up to 10% of children and most are treated with topical agents or cryotherapy. Occlusive therapy with duct tape has been used for years by parents for the treatment of their children''s warts with anecdotal success published as early as 1978.[1] Duct tape therapy is inexpensive causes little pain reduces the need of frequent follow-up and provides parents with a mechanism of treating their children at home. Nevertheless many clinicians have regarded its effectiveness as an old wives'' tale as no randomized trial had demonstrated its efficacy.',/wiki/Duct_Tape_for_Treatment_of_the_Common_Wart,,
Among patients with recurrent C. difficile-associated diarrhea how does fecal transplant compare with vancomycin in terms of relapse?,Prior use of antibiotics disturbs the normal gut microbiome and increases the risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).  Current treatment for recurrent CDAD involves additional courses of antibiotics including metronidazole vancomycin (Vancomycin vs. Metronidazole in C. difficile Diarrhea; 2007) rifaximin and fidaxomicin (Fidaxomicin vs. Vancomycin for C. difficile Diarrhea; 2011). Together these treatments have a failure rate of up to 25% on first recurrence which increases with subsequent recurrences. ,/wiki/Duodenal_Infusion_of_Donor_Feces_for_Recurrent_Clostridium_difficile,,
In patients with metastatic NSCLC how does early introduction of palliative care affect quality of life?,Patients with stage I II or III NSCLC are generally treated with curative intent using surgery chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In contrast patients with stage IV metastatic NSCLC may benefit from palliative systemic therapy. However early integration of palliative care into standard oncologic care is not the standard of care. ,/wiki/Early_Palliative_Care,,
Among selected high-risk patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for acute variceal bleeding does the early use of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reduce the treatment failure and mortality rate?,Patients with hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension develop portosystemic collaterals including gastroesophageal varices rupture of which results in variceal hemorrhage. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that rapid pharmacologic and endoscopic management of variceal bleeding leads to early resolution of hemorrhage and improves hemodynamic parameters but does not necessarily improve survival.[1] Failure rates remain high and mortality may be as high as 20%.[2] In patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement may reduce the portosystemic pressure gradient and reduce bleeding from active varices. One study demonstrated the efficacy of early TIPS in patients with variceal hemorrhage refractory to pharmacologic and endoscopic interventions[3] but this study was limited by less aggressive therapy administered to the control group and by the use of older (non-contemporary) uncovered TIPS stents. Additionally some studies suggest that early TIPS reduces rates of variceal bleeding without improving survival. Therefore a properly controlled randomized trial of early TIPS was required to more conclusively demonstrate its efficacy.,/wiki/Early_TIPS,,
Among patients with left-sided native-valve endocarditis at high risk of embolic events does early surgery reduce mortality and embolic events as compared to conventional treatment?,Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy in infective endocarditis (IE) with surgery historically reserved for those with valvular regurgitation and heart failure or refractory embolic events. To better understand the optimal timing of surgical intervention in this patient population these investigators sought to study the role of early surgery as a means of preventing mortality and embolic events in patients with native-valve left-sided endocarditis (NVE).,/wiki/EASE,,
In patients with recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation can early rhythm control reduce the risk of CV mortality stroke HF hospitalization or ACS hospitalization?,The 2002 AFFIRM trial randomized seniors with AF to rate vs. rhythm control strategies. It found a trend towards increased mortality with a rhythm control strategy (P=0.08). Mortality was highest among subgroups that were older had a history of CAD or without prior HF. Whether there was a benefit from early earlier rhythm control in AF was unknown. Additionally the rhythm control arm was allowed to stop anticoagulation if the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm for at least 4 consecutive weeks but rates of ischemic stroke were similar between both groups. Additionally rhythm control agents were predominantly sotalol or amiodarone which have high rates of adverse effects compared to newer agents such as dronedarone.,/wiki/EAST-AFNET_4,,
In patients with acute ischemic stroke does the administration of alteplase a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) reduce disability at 3 months? ,The 2008 European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III (ECASS III) demonstrated a benefit of intravenous alteplase beyond the conventional 3-hour time window established in the NINDS trial (1995) effectively extending the window for alteplase to 4.5 hours.  The primary outcome was disability at 3 months and ECASS III found a greater proportion of patients randomized to alteplase with complete or near complete neurologic recovery (NNT 14).  Despite a 10-fold increase in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage there was no difference in mortality between alteplase and placebo groups.  Of note patients with severe signs of stroke were excluded and the placebo group had higher rates of prior stroke which may have accounted for the worsened outcomes.,/wiki/ECASS_III,,
In patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis does CEA reduce the risk of major stroke or death?,The uncertain benefit of CEA for the secondary prevention of carotid artery territory stroke led to several major studies being undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s. The European Surgical Carotid Trial (ESCT) and North American Symptomatic Carotid Artery Trial (NASCET) were among the largest to study CEA in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.,/wiki/ECST,,
In patients with T1DM what is the benefit of intensive therapy in reducing the long-term incidence of a CV event?,The earlier Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) investigated CV outcomes among T1DM patients but failed to demonstrate a reduction in CV events likely because the study population was relatively young at the time. The follow-up Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) cohort study did demonstrate such benefits.,/wiki/EDIC,,
In patients with VTE who have completed 6-12 months of anticoagulation does long-term rivaroxaban treatment reduce the rate of recurrent VTE compared to aspirin?,The majority of patients with provoked VTE can be treated with a limited course of anticoagulation therapy (e.g. 3-6 months) followed by therapy discontinuation. In patients without reversible risk factors for VTE the risk of recurrent VTE remains elevated after 6-12 months of therapeutic anticoagulation and extended-duration anticoagulation is often warranted. The bleeding risk associated with extended-duration anticoagulation have led investigators to evaluate intermediate- or low-dose antithrombotic agents in this setting. This includes the ASPIRE and WARFASA trials of aspirin and the AMPLIFY-EXT trial of apixaban. ,/wiki/EINSTEIN_CHOICE,,
Among patients with acute PE is rivaroxaban noninferior to warfarin in preventing recurrent VTE or bleeding?,The oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban demonstrated effectiveness in the prevention of VTE following orthopedic surgery in RECORD1 (2009)[1] in DVT treatment in EINSTEIN-DVT (2010)[2] and in AF in ROCKET AF (2011). EINSTEIN-PE was an extension of the EINSTEIN program and was the first large randomized study of rivaroxaban in the treatment of acute PE.,/wiki/EINSTEIN-PE,,
In patients undergoing renal transplantation what is the comparative effectiveness of four immunosuppressive regimens in the maintenance of graft function at 12 months?,Immunosuppression reduces the incidence of acute allograft rejection among patients who have undergone kidney transplantation. Many immunosuppressive agents are available. Cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) are calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) that are associated with nephrotoxicity hypertension and hyperlipidemia.[1] Sirolimus (SRL) is an mTOR inhibitor associated with thrombocytopenia diarrhea[2] hyperlipidemia and delayed wound healing. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an antimetabolite that inhibits B- and T-cell proliferation and is associated with bone marrow suppression and diarrhea.[3] The optimal immunosuppressive regimen and dose intensity has been up for debate.,/wiki/ELITE-Symphony,,
Does 30-day EKG monitoring compared with 24-h Holter monitoring improve detection of atrial fibrillation in patients following cryptogenic stroke?,Approximately one-quarter of ischemic strokes and half of TIAs have an etiology that is not identified readily after the routine evaluation and are labeled as cryptogenic. It has long been suspected that a significant portion of these patients have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is not identified during the conventional Holter monitoring period which is part of this standard evaluation. A prior randomized study demonstrated improved AF detection with extended EKG monitoring of up to 1 week following cryptogenic stroke.[1],/wiki/EMBRACE,,
Among patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane does trastuzumab-emtansine prolong PFS and OS when compared to lapatanib+capecitabine?,The 2012 Emtansine vs. Capecitabine plus Lapatinib in Patients with HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (EMILIA) trial randomized 991 women with HER2-positive unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane to either trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) or standard-of-care lapatinib+capecitabine. At a mean follow-up of about 18 months T-DM1 was associated with prolonged progression-free survival (9.6 vs. 6.4 months) and overall survival (30.9 vs. 25.1). The antibody-drug conjugate was associated with fewer grade ≥3 adverse events (40.8% vs. 57%) and serious events resulting in treatment discontinuation (5.9% vs. 10.7%) and did not appear to increase the incidence of cardiotoxicity (1 vs. 5 events).,/wiki/EMILIA,,
Among patients with T2DM at high risk for CV events does daily empagliflozin 10 or 25 mg reduce CV mortality nonfatal MI or nonfatal strokes when compared to placebo?,Excess mortality in T2DM is largely related to an increased incidence of CV disease.[1] In the 1998 UKPDS 34 study metformin was associated with reduced all-cause mortality. The 2005 PROactive study not only failed to demonstrate a reduction in all-cause mortality with pioglitazone; the drug was associated with excess HF hospitalizations.[2] Subsequent studies of newer agents including the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin (TECOS 2015[3]) and the GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide (ELIXA 2015[4]) have also been unable to demonstrate a significant improvement in cardiovascular outcomes among selected patients with T2DM. ,/wiki/EMPA-REG_OUTCOME,,
In adults with heart failure with mid-range or preserved ejection fraction does empagliflozin reduce the risk of the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure?,Chronic heart failure (HF) has 3 major subtypes defined by LVEF 1. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with LVEF ≥50% 2. Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) with LVEF 40-<50% and 3. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with LVEF <40%.[1] HFpEF accounts for about 50% of chronic HF.[2] Unlike HFrEF there are few therapies that improve HFpEF endpoints. (Of note emerging evidence that HFmrEF may respond to HFrEF interventions including ARBs beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockade.)[3] There is critical need to identify effective therapies in HFpEF. The CHARM-Preserved trial compared candesartan to placebo in patients with HFpEF but was not found to decrease the risk of the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or HF admission in a statistically significant manner (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-1.00). TOPCAT compared spironolactone to placebo and did not find a difference in the composite of cardiovascular mortality aborted cardiac arrest or heart failure hospitalization (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77-1.04). Subgroup analysis comparing Eastern European participants vs.other participants did find a significant reduction in the primary endpoint for those outside Eastern Europe. Spironolactone were undetectable in a much larger proportion of Eastern European participants which was thought to mean they may have not been receiving the study medication. PARAGON-HF compared sacubitril-valsartan to valsartan and also did not find a statistically significant difference in the composite of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.75-1.01).,/wiki/EMPEROR-Preserved,,
Among patients with HFrEF does the addition of eplerenone to standard therapy improve survival?,The 1999 RALES trial revealed that the addition of spironolactone (a nonselective aldosterone antagonist) to usual medical care improved survival and reduced hospitalizations among individuals with moderate systolic dysfunction and NYHA class III-IV symptoms. The follow-up 2003 EPHESUS trial demonstrated similar results with eplerenone (a selective aldosterone antagonist) among patients with MI complicated by LV dysfunction. The role of aldosterone antagonism among patients with mild symptoms had not yet been studied in chronic HFrEF however.,/wiki/EMPHASIS-HF,,
Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation how does edoxaban a factor Xa inhibitor compare with warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism?,The seminal SPAF trials in the 1990s established the use of warfarin as a cornerstone for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin a vitamin K antagonist has been the gold standard in stroke prevention for patients with AF for many decades but is associated with numerous adverse effects owing to a narrow therapeutic margin and wide variability in dose response necessitating frequent coagulation monitoring[1] and INR values within the therapeutic range only about 60% of the time.[2] Given the poor time in therapeutic range (TTR) and difficulty in dosing warfarin it has been hypothesized that non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) may be a better alternative for preventing stroke and decreasing mortality in patients with AF. Numerous prior NOAC trials including ARISTOTLE RE-LY and ROCKET AF have had favorable results. ,/wiki/ENGAGE_AF-TIMI_48,,
In patients requiring VTE prophylaxis after total hip or knee arthroplasty how do aspirin and rivaroxaban compare in terms of rates of symptomatic VTE and bleeding? ,The risk of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty without postoperative anticoagulation is estimated at approximately 6% by the Caprini score.[1] As a consequence postoperative VTE prophylaxis is a standard of care for patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty. Several agents are used for VTE prophylaxis following orthopedic surgery including aspirin enoxaparin warfarin rivaroxaban apixaban and others. Randomized trials are lacking and thus the optimal agent dose and duration of VTE prophylaxis remains undefined.,/wiki/EPCAT_II,,
In patients with acute MI complicated by LV dysfunction and HF symptoms does eplerenone reduce mortality?,While RALES (1999) and EMPHASIS-HF (2011) demonstrated a mortality benefit of aldosterone antagonists in HFrEF the 2003 Eplerenone Post–Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) demonstrated a 15% reduced mortality with the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone in LV dysfunction complicating acute MI. Eplerenone was also associated with reductions in sudden cardiac death and hospitalizations for HF.  Importantly this study was done in the era of widespread beta-blocker use in contrast to the RALES study in which only 10% patients were on beta-blocker therapy.,/wiki/EPHESUS,,
In males ages 50-74 does Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) screening every 4 years reduce the risk of death from prostate cancer?,The first Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test was released in 1986 and approved by the FDA in 1994 in conjunction with digital rectal examination to test asymptomatic men for prostate cancer.[1] Initially many organizations recommended yearly screening for prostate cancer in men over the age of 50. The optimal screening interval or even the need for screening was unknown though and so multiple large clinical trials including European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Prostate Lung Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were initiated to look at the benefits vs. risks of PSA screening.,/wiki/ERSPC,,
In patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure does placement of a pulmonary artery catheter and its resultant data improve survival when when compared to clinical assessment alone?,'Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) including the Swan-Ganz catheter developed in the 1960s-1970s allow direct measurement of central hemodynamics at the bedside. This has been widely regarded as useful in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) as it allows tailored therapy based upon a patient''s response to diuretics vasopressors and inotropes.[1][2][3] Their use was common in ADHF management at the turn of the millennium despite a lack of randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness.',/wiki/ESCAPE,,
In patients with TIAs or minor ischemic strokes does combination aspirin/dipyridamole reduce rates of vascular mortality non-fatal stroke non-fatal MI or non-fatal major bleeding when compared to aspirin alone?,Prior studies demonstrated the efficacy of single-agent aspirin or single-agent dipyridamole for secondary stroke prevention but studies of combination aspirin/dipyridamole therapy yielded conflicting results. The most promising study to date had been ESPS-2 (1996)[1] which suggested a modest benefit to combination therapy but its results had not been confirmed.,/wiki/ESPRIT,,
In patients with UA/NSTEMI does enoxaparin reduce rates of death MI or recurrent angina at 14 days when compared to unfractionated heparin?,The efficacy of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in UA/NSTEMI was first demonstrated in the ATACS trial (1994).[1] Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has the advantage of once- and twice-daily subcutaneous dosing and more predictable therapeutic effects.[2] Thus investigators wished to compare LMWH to UFH in UA/NSTEMI.,/wiki/ESSENCE,,
In patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the antiplatelet ticagrelor superior to clopidogrel with regards to prevention of cardiovascular death MI or ischemic stroke?,PAD or symptomatic ischemia of the extremities due to poor arterial flow secondary to atherosclerotic plaque is considered a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. As a result these patients are at high risk for other sequelae of atherosclerosis including MI ischemic stroke and cardiovascular death. Given this elevated risk it stands to reason that patients with PAD (like patients with CAD or cerebral atherosclerosis) would benefit from systemic antiplatelet therapy. This benefit was suggested in the CAPRIE trial in which the administration of clopidogrel in patients with atherosclerosis reduced cardiovascular events when compared to aspirin (particularly in the PAD subgroup). The subsequent MATCH and CHARISMA trials assessed the utility of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis (including PAD) and demonstrated no improvement over clopidogrel alone with excess bleeding. More recently the PLATO trial investigating the newer P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor demonstrated superior thrombotic protection (including mortality benefit) over clopidogrel in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Furthermore an analysis of the PAD subgroup in the PEGASUS-TIMI-54 trial suggested a greater benefit with ticagrelor over clopidogrel in this population given high baseline risk of CV events. Prior to EUCLID however a rigorous investigation of the benefit of ticagrelor in PAD patients had yet to be done.,/wiki/EUCLID_(Ticagrelor),,
In patients with stable CAD without heart failure does perindopril reduce CV mortality MI or cardiac arrest as compared to placebo?,ACE inhibitors are a mainstay of therapy in patients with a variety of CV disease subtypes and CV risk factors. In 1992 SAVE showed that captopril significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality fatal and nonfatal CV events and heart failure in patients with LV dysfunction following MI.[1] In 2000 HOPE demonstrated that ramipril decreased the risk of MI stroke and CV mortality in patients at high risk of CV disease.[2] Others including CONSENSUS and SOLVD established the role of ACE inhibitors in symptomatic HFrEF. The role of ACE inhibition in patients with stable CAD had not yet been well established.,/wiki/EUROPA,,
In patients with acute bacterial meningitis does adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone improve outcomes compared to standard antibiotic therapy alone?,Randomized trials of adjuvant dexamethasone therapy for acute bacterial meningitis have demonstrated mixed results between developed and developing countries.  ,/wiki/European_Dexamethasone_Study,,
In patients with HFrEF on standard therapy does 60 days of tolvaptan reduce mortality or rehospitalization rates when compared to placebo?,Diuretics are central to the management of hospitalizations for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and are widely used as maintenance medications for outpatients with HFrEF. Hyponatremia is a poor prognosticator in HF and the V2 receptor has previously been associated with the deleterious neurohormonal pathways in HFrEF; antagonism of these receptors has been hypothesized to prevent progression of the disease.[1] Tolvaptan a V2 antagonist has been thought to play a dual role in both loss of free water through aquaresis and in the prevention of HF progression.,/wiki/EVEREST-Outcomes,,
Among ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis does cinacalcet reduce the rate of death or CV events?,Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease among patients with CKD possibly mediated by increased arterial stiffness and LV hypertrophy.[1][2] Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that primarily acts as an allosteric modulator of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) to reduce serum PTH calcium and phosphorus levels and possibly inhibit vascular calcification.[3] Cinacalcet and other calcimimetics have been widely used for these benefits but whether these effects would impact rates of CV events among ESRD patients was unknown.,/wiki/EVOLVE,,
In patients with left main coronary artery disease and low to intermediate anatomic complexity (SYNTAX score ≤ 32) is contemporary PCI with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) noninferior to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in regards to long-term cardiovascular outcomes?,While the standard of care for patients presenting with symptomatic CAD attributable to left main coronary artery disease has been surgical revascularization with CABG this practice has been based on older RCT data using bare-metal stents or 1st generation DES. ,/wiki/EXCEL,,
In patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma on inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists does omalizumab reduce asthma exacerbations?,Omalizumab is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and rescue medications in patients ≥12 years with moderate- to severe- persistent asthma uncontrolled on ICS [1]. Omalizumab is approved by the FDA in patients with asthma uncontrolled on ICS but the role of omalizumab as an adjunct to both high-dose ICS and long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) for severe asthma[2] was unclear.,/wiki/EXTRA,,
In patients with ALI/ARDS that are intubated and receiving positive pressure ventilation how does the conservative compare to the liberal fluid management strategy in reducing mortality?,Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with a high mortality -- up to 46% at 60 days for ARDS.[1] The only major improvement in mortality had been the ARDSNet (2000) low tidal volume protocol. Pulmonary edema plays a significant role in the ALI/ARDS disease process reducing the degree of pulmonary edema through a conservative fluid strategy may benefit in reducing mortality. ,/wiki/FACTT,,
In patients with symptomatic HFrEF and concomitant iron deficiency does IV iron improve heart failure symptoms compared to placebo?,Despite improvements in the medical management of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) morbidity related to reduced exercise tolerance and functional capacity remains a significant problem. Although the cause of reduced functional status in this condition is multifactorial impaired oxygen delivery is thought to be a major contributor. Iron deficiency with or without anemia has been showed to impair aerobic performance and incidence of iron deficiency is increased among patients with HFrEF. A small study in patients with chronic heart failure suggested the possibility of symptomatic benefit of IV iron replacement in this population even in patients without anemia[1] and investigators sought to confirm these findings in a larger randomized study.,/wiki/FAIR-HF,,
In patients with multivessel CAD does a fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided PCI reduce death nonfatal MI and repeat revascularization compared to PCI alone?,The role of coronary revascularization in reducing symptoms MI and death has been amply studied in ACS but its role in stable CAD has remained elusive. One problem is that conventional PCI has traditionally relied upon angiographic analysis of lesions. For example COURAGE (2007) and SYNTAX (2009) respectively studied PCI and CABG for stable CAD and failed to demonstrate a benefit with routine revascularization of unselected coronary lesions when compared to optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone. This led some investigators to speculate that the null results came about from PCI to vessels not inducing ischemia. What followed were studies of targeted revascularization of physiologically significant lesions. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) the mean distal pressure of the diseased coronary artery divided by mean aortic pressure was developed in the early 1990s as a means of selecting physiologically significant lesions. DEFER (2001) demonstrated that coronary revascularization could be safely deferred when lesions had an FFR greater than 0.75.[1] The Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) investigators hypothesized that FFR-guided revascularization of physiologically significant lesions could improve outcomes in stable CAD when compared to conventional angiography-guided PCI.,/wiki/FAME,,
Among patients with stable CAD with fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80 does PCI (including dual antiplatelet therapy) reduce the composite of all-cause mortality non-fatal MI or urgent revascularization when compared to optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone?,Fractional flow reserve (FFR) identifies physiologically significant coronary stenoses by objectively measuring flow reduction caused by an atheroma rather than depending on traditional more subjective angiographic visual inspection. The original FAME trial (2009) demonstrated that FFR-guided PCI was superior to the angiography-guided PCI of that era among patients with stable multivessel CAD. ,/wiki/FAME_2,,
In Sub-Saharan African pediatric patients presenting in shock does early resuscitation with either saline or albumin compare to a no-bolus strategy in terms of all-cause mortality at 48 hours?,'Despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting its efficacy fluid resuscitation was incorporated into practice guidelines for the treatment of children with septic shock in 2002.[1] Most patients receive crystalloids such as normal saline or lactated Ringer''s solution (LR) although there are theoretical benefits to colloids such as albumin. While trials such as SAFE and ALBIOS attempt to address this debate the question of whether fluid resuscitation is necessary at all has resurfaced. Resource-limited areas like sub-Saharan Africa often do not have adequate intensive care capabilities and often do not provide fluid resuscitation as their standard of care. This provided an ideal locale to compare the local standard of care (no fluids) with fluid resuscitation according to conventional Western guidelines.',/wiki/FEAST,,
In patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is treatment with fidaxomicin non-inferior to vancomycin in terms of clinical cure?,Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is a major adverse effect of antibiotic usage and its incidence is on the rise particularly among hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the Vancomycin vs. Metronidazole in C. difficile Diarrhea trial (2007) demonstrated superiority of vancomycin for severe disease there have remained unacceptably high recurrence rates even among patients appropriately treated.,/wiki/Fidaxomicin_in_C._difficile_Diarrhea,,
In patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs referred for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) does balloon cryoablation result in similar efficacy to traditional radiofrequency ablation in terms of long-term atrial fibrillation-free survival?,Catheter ablation for drug-refractory symptomatic paroxsymal atrial fibrillation (pAF) carries a class I indication (level of evidence A) according to the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS consensus guidelines. [1] Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) a process by which circumferential lesions are made around each pulmonary vein is the standard approach to pAF ablation. There are two primary technologies utilized to perform PVI - radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and balloon cryoablation. RFA achieves PVI by applying radiofrequency current in a point-by-point process around each pulmonary vein. Balloon cryoablation uses cryogenic energy to create a circular freeze around each pulmonary vein in a single step. ,/wiki/FIRE_AND_ICE,,
Among patients with COPD and mMRC dyspnea grade ≥2 symptoms does indacaterol+glycopyrronium (LABA+LAMA) reduce rates of annual COPD exacerbations when compared to salmeterol+fluticasone (LABA+ICS)?,COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and 80-90% of its prevalence is attributable to cigarette smoking.[1] While high-quality evidence supports smoking cessation for prevention of COPD progression[2] and reduction in mortality[3] the search for the ideal medication to reduce COPD exacerbations is ongoing. One popular intervention ICS therapy has been associated with increased risk of pneumonia.[4] Further combined LABA+ICS therapy (salmeterol+fluticasone) had a similar COPD exacerbation rate as LAMA monotherapy (tiotropium) in INSPIRE (2008).[5] Whether LABA+LAMA therapy provides benefit over LABA+ICS was unknown. ,/wiki/FLAME_(COPD),,
Does the early administration of fluoxetine in addition to conventional physiotherapy improve motor recovery following ischemic strokes? ,Several small case-series suggest that early SSRIs administration may promote motor recovery after ischemic stroke. This effect is proposed to be due to a non-vascular mechanism possibly related to a serotonin-mediated suppression of post-stroke hyperexcitability in the unaffected hemisphere leading to improved neuroplasticity.[1],/wiki/FLAME_(Stroke),,
Among high-risk patients undergoing hip surgery does a liberal transfusion strategy (target hemoglobin >10 g/dL) improve survival or functional outcomes at 60 days compared to a restrictive strategy (target hemoglobin >8 g/dL)?,Red-cell transfusions are costly and potentially high-risk interventions in medical and surgical patients. Efforts have long been underway to limit unnecessary red-cell transfusions by implementing restrictive transfusion thresholds across patient populations. The role of a restrictive transfusion strategy was evaluated in several studies including TRICC in ICU patients TRISS in patients with sepsis and in Transfusion Strategies for Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding. Whether a restrictive transfusion strategy could be safely employed in patients undergoing elective hip surgery especially those at high risk of a cardiovascular event had not been demonstrated in a well designed randomized clinical trial.,/wiki/FOCUS,,
Among patients with clinical atherosclerotic disease and LDL >70 despite high- or moderate-intensity statin therapy does the addition of PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduce major cardiovascular events compared to placebo? ,Multiple large RCTs including 4S MIRACL and PROVE IT-TIMI 22 have established the role of statin therapy in reducing future cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with established atherosclerotic disease. The subsequent IMPROVE-IT trial demonstrated that the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy further reduces CV events in this population suggesting that maximal LDL reduction is the key mechanism in improving outcomes in patients with established atherosclerotic disease. ,/wiki/FOURIER,,
Among diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease how does revascularization with CABG compare to PCI in terms of rates of death myocardial infarction and stroke?,Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and CAD tend to have more extensive atherosclerotic disease than those without diabetes. As a result these patients may derive a particular benefit from bypass grafting over percutaneous coronary revascularization in the setting of multivessel CAD. BARI (1996)[1] was one of the first trials to demonstrate a survival benefit with CABG over coronary angioplasty in patients with DM and multivessel CAD. Furthermore the related BARI 2D (2009) suggested that CABG was superior to PCI with bare metal stents (BMS) in patients with DM although it did not compare the two approaches directly. Similarly SYNTAX (2009) which randomized patients with multivessel CAD to CABG versus first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) demonstrated a higher rate of major adverse coronary and cerebrovascular events an effect that was more pronounced in patients with DM.,/wiki/FREEDOM,,
In patients with UA/NSTEMI does early invasive management reduce MI recurrence and mortality compared to a non-invasive approach?,A challenge in modern cardiology is distinguishing between which patients with unstable angina will progress to myocardial infarction which patients with NSTEMI will benefit from revascularization and which of these patients will stabilize on optimal medical therapy alone. As a result two approaches have come to the fore: conservative and early invasive strategies. The former approach begins with optimal medical management and limits coronary catheterization to patients with refractory or recurrent angina or a positive stress test. The latter approach uses early cardiac catheterization within 24-48 hours and revascularization if appropriate. (Of note this differs from the emergent coronary angiography and reperfusion via thrombolysis or primary PCI indicated in STEMI.) In addition risk assessment tools such as the TIMI or GRACE risk scores have been developed in an attempt to determine prognosis and identify patients at high risk for complications such as recurrent MI and death.  ,/wiki/FRISC-II,,
In critically ill patients what are the risk factors for developing gastrointestinal hemorrhage?,A 1969 case series by Skillman et al. first described the association of critical illness with development of stress ulcers and their subsequent bleeding.[1] A 1991 meta-analysis[2] demonstrated that prophylaxis with antacids sulcralfate and H2 blockers reduced the rate of this complication. However given how time consuming and expensive these therapies were[3] identifying which patients would most benefit from their use would inform medical practice. (Additionally early evidence hinting to an increased risk for nosocomial pneumonias with ulcer prophylaxis was emerging[4] though a 2009 cohort study suggests that this may only be associated with PPI use.[5]),/wiki/GI_bleeding_in_ICU_patients,,
Among patients with acute MI and preserved LV systolic function does the addition of lisinopril reduce short-term mortality?,'Although several studies (including the 1992 SAVE trial) have investigated the role of ACE inhibitors among patients with MI complicated by LV dysfunction the role of the medication in those with an MI with preserved LVEF was unknown. The 1994 Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell''infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3) trial randomized 19394 patients with MI with preserved LVEF to lisinopril nitrates or control in a 2x2 factorial design. At 6 weeks lisinopril was associated with a modest but significant 0.8% absolute reduction in mortality  -- an 11% odds reduction -- when compared to placebo.',/wiki/GISSI-3,,
Among patients with ACS does administration of streptokinase tPA or both in addition to heparin and ASA reduce all-cause mortality at 30 days?,Restoration of coronary perfusion in MI was identified as a potential therapeutic intervention as early as 1912 with the first studies of thrombolytics/fibrinolytics (originally streptokinase [SK]) occurring in the 1950s.[1][2] The first large study to demonstrate efficacy of thrombolytics in ACS was the unblinded GISSI trial[3] (1986). This was confirmed in the double-blinded ISIS-2 trial (1988). ,/wiki/GUSTO,,
In patients with cardiac arrest due to VF or pulseless VT does mild hypothermia improve neurologic outcomes compared with standard care normothermia?,Hypoxemic-ischemic brain injury is the most common cause of death in patients after cardiac arrest. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that lowering brain temperature to 32 to 34° C reduces the risk of neurologic injury and improves neurologic outcomes. The 2002 Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest (HACA) trial randomly assigned 275 patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after witnessed cardiac arrest due to VF or pulseless VT to mild therapeutic hypothermia (32 to 34° C) or to standard normothermia. At six months HACA demonstrated improved neurologic outcomes in the hypothermia group compared to the normothermia group. The authors estimate that six patients would need to be treated with induced hypothermia to prevent one unfavorable neurologic outcome. In addition therapeutic hypothermia improved survival such that to prevent one death seven patients would need to be treated with induced hypothermia. A concurrent publication by Benard et al.[1] found a benefit with therapeutic hypothermia for functional outcomes in a similar population.,/wiki/HACA,,
In patients with advanced heart failure do continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices improve survival free from disabling stroke and device failure as compared with pulsatile devices?,The REMATCH and INTrEPID Trial evaluated the role of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in patients with advanced heart failure who are ineligible for heart transplant. In the REMATCH trial patients who received LVAD had a 48% reduction in mortality as compared with medical-therapy (OMT) (relative risk 0.52 95 % CI 0.34-0.78 P=0.001). [1] Similarly the INTrePID trial showed a significant survival advantage with LVAD as compared to OMT. [2] The LVAD used in these studies were pulsatile-flow devices with a larger size and less durability as compared to new continuous-flow LVAD. In the HEARTMATE II study continuous-flow LVAD (HeartMate II abbreviated as HMII) was compared to pulsatile-flow LVAD (HeartMate XVE) for destination therapy with the primary endpoint of 2-year survival free from disabling stroke and LVAD failure.

In adult ICU patients with fever and probable infection does administration of acetaminophen result in more ICU-free days compared to no treatment of the fever?,Antipyretic agents are commonly administered to ICU patients with fever from a known or suspected infection on the assumption that restoration of a euthermic state may reduce physiological stress. Yet at the same time fever may impair microorganism growth enhance the efficacy of antibiotics and may have additional favorable effects and thus the routine use of antipyretic agents such as acetaminophen has been called into question.,/wiki/HEAT,,
In patients undergoing hemodialysis does a higher dialysis dose or a high-flux dialyzer membrane reduce all-cause mortality?,Dialysis dose and size of molecules removed are important factors in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.[1] Expressed as Kt/V guidelines at the time of this study recommended a single-pool Kt/V of >1.2.[2] The Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study aimed to determine the effect of a higher dialysis dose (target equilibrated Kt/V 1.45) and a high-flux dialyzer membrane on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing thrice-weekly hemodialysis as compared to standard-dose (target equilibrated Kt/V 1.05) and low-flux membrane.[3],/wiki/HEMO,,
In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer does trastuzumab improve disease-free survival after adjuvant chemotherapy? ,Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the HER2/neu gene product which is overexpressed in 15-25% of breast cancers and is associated with an aggressive phenotype. While previous studies have shown that trastuzumab benefits those with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial investigated the role of trastuzumab administered after primary treatment consisting of surgery radiation and chemotherapy.,/wiki/HERA,,
Among patients with cancer-associated VTE how does the factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban compare with the low-molecular-weight heparin agent dalteparin in terms of recurrent VTE and bleeding complications?,Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication of cancer and its treatment.[1] Patients with cancer-associated VTE have a higher risk of recurrent VTE and encounter more bleeding when on anticoagulation compared to patients without cancer and thus the management of these patients poses particular challenges. The CLOT trial (2003) demonstrated that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE among patients with cancer-associated VTE when compared to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy establishing LMWH as the standard of care for this patient population.[2] As the direct-acting anticoagulants (DOACs) became available a logical question was whether DOACs would be effective in patients with cancer-associated VTE. The randomized DOAC versus VKA trials included few patients with malignancy and subsequent meta-analyses of patients from these and other randomized trials demonstrated favorable effects on recurrence and bleeding rates with DOACs compared to VKAs and LMWH in patients with cancer-associated VTE.[3] Randomized trials in patients with cancer-associated VTE were needed.,/wiki/Hokusai-VTE,,
In patients with multiple CV risk factors does ramipril reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality?,CONSENSUS (1987) SOLVD (1991) and SAVE (1992) demonstrated the benefit of enalapril and captopril in reducing mortality and hospitalizations among patients with reduced systolic function. However the role of ACE inhibitors was unclear among patients with multiple CV risk factors and preserved systolic function.,/wiki/HOPE,,
In patients with sickle cell disease does voxelotor 1500mg increase baseline hemoglobin of patients?,'Sickle cell disease is a chronic disease with numerous acute and chronic clinical manifestations that results in premature mortality among persons afflicted by the condition. Despite its commonality there are few treatment options available to improve improve clinical outcomes. The hallmark of sickle cell disease is polymerization of HbS and resultant sickling of RBCs. This leads to multiple events related to microvascular occlusion (eg infarctions pain) intravascular hemolysis (eg anemia) and adverse inflammation.[1] One of the factors contributing to HgS polymerization is low oxygen. Voxelotor is an oral targeted therapy that increases hemoglobin''s oxygen affinity and reduces hypoxia-related polymerization.[2] Prior to 2019 it had not been assessed in a large trial.',/wiki/HOPE_(Sickle_Cell_Disease),,
Among patients with intermediate cardiovascular disease risk does rosuvastatin hydrochlorthiazide/candesartan or a combination of both interventions reduce CVD events when compared to placebo?,Note: Three interrelated HOPE-3 manuscripts were published simultaneously: Antihypertensives+statin treatment[1] statin treatment[2] and antihypertensive treatment.[3] All three are reviewed here.,/wiki/HOPE-3,,
Among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis does annual zoledronate infusion reduce the rate of vertebral hip and other fractures compared to placebo?,Osteoporosis affects 7% of those age 50-59 12% of those age 60-69 26% of those age 70-79 and 35% of women age ≥80 years.[1] Osteoporotic fractures are a major cause of disability for women and contribute $14 billion in annual costs in the US.[2] The time following a fracture is associated with excess risk in mortality. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone reabsorption and increase bone mineral density (BMD) and the oral bisphosphonates alendronate and risendronate reduce the rate of fractures among individuals with osteoporosis. Adherence to these daily or weekly oral regimens can be poor and a less frequent dosing schedule was desirable. ,/wiki/HORIZON-PFT,,
Among patients admitted to hematology wards with high-risk neutropenic fever without microbial diagnosis does stopping empiric antibiotics once the patient has been clinically stable & afebrile for 72 hours increase the number of antibiotic-free days compared to continuing antibiotics until neutrophil recovery?,Management of febrile neutropenia with antibiotics has historically involved use of empiric antimicrobial therapy (EAT) until resolution of fever and neutropenia.[1] This practice was not supported by high-quality evidence. Among patients with febrile neutropenia neutropenia may persist for weeks or months and continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for such a long duration may be associated with more harm than benefit. ,/wiki/How_Long,,
In patients with high risk for CVD does simvastatin reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as compared to placebo?,HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in certain high risk patient groups. For example  4S (1994) and LIPID (1998) found statins to reduce all-cause mortality among patients with prior MI.  Similarly study reported the benefit of Pravastatin in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and different cholesterol levels.[1] The AFCAPS showed that Lovastatin is effective in patients without atherosclerotic CAD with average total cholesterol LDL-C and below-average HDL-C levels.[2],/wiki/HPS_Statin,,
Among patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy does niacin+laropiprant reduce major vascular event when compared to placebo?,Population studies have identified high LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol as independent risk factors for CHD and CHD mortality.  The effects of niacin (vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid) are many and are thought to reduce LDL through inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2-mediated triglyceride synthesis and increase HDL levels by reducing catabolism of HDL particles.[1] This therapy is particularly attractive for its strong effects on increasing HDL.[2] In the pre-statin era niacin was found to modestly reduce mortality in patients with CHD.[3] Trials subsequent to the widespread use of statins have had conflicting results. For example the 2004 ARBITER 2 trial[4] found that niacin added to statin therapy was associated with a reduction in carotid intima-media thickness (a surrogate for atherosclerosis progression) among individuals with known CHD while the 2011 AIM-HIGH trial[5] found no reduction in clinical outcomes (eg CHD mortality) when niacin was added to statin therapy in patients with CHD. Whether the therapy would benefit a more heterogeneous group of patients with atherosclerotic disease on statin therapy was unknown.,/wiki/HPS2-THRIVE,,
Does early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduce HIV transmission among HIV-serodiscordant couples and reduce morbidity among HIV-seropositive partners?,Several prospective cohort studies in Africa demonstrated that ART in the HIV-seropositive partner reduced transmission to the HIV-seronegative partner.  The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 trial was the first RCT to determine whether ART of the HIV-seropositive partner (CD4 between 350-550 cells/mm3) decreased transmission to the HIV-seronegative partner.  The HPTN 052 trial randomized 1763 HIV-serodiscordant almost entirely heterosexual couples to initiation of early ART (CD4 count 350-550) or delayed ART (CD4 count <250 or after AIDS-defining illness).  Viral gene sequencing after seroconversion determined whether HIV transmission was linked between couples.,/wiki/HPTN_052,,
Among patients presenting to an ED with chest pain who had a high-sensitivity troponin-T <5 ng/L and no EKG changes what is the 30 day incidence of MI?,'Acute chest pain is a common complaint in the emergency department but is caused by MI a minority of the time. Traditional troponin assays lag behind onset of necrosis-related symptoms in MI.[1] As a result these labs must be checked serially (eg q6h x3) to ''rule out'' individuals presenting with chest pain or other symptoms concerning for MI. A more rapid method to rule out ED patients with chest pain would result in savings for the health care system. The 2012 ROMICAT-II[2] study found that use of coronary CT scanning in evaluating acute chest pain was associated with an 8 hour reduction in hospital stay but no cost savings. High-sensitivity (HS) troponin-T is thought to be an improvement over the traditional troponin study as it more rapidly detects myocardial damage. Prospective studies have found a high NPV when HS troponin-T was measured serially (at least twice) among patients presenting with acute chest pain.[3][4] Whether a single measurement would be associated with a high NPV in all-comers was unclear.',/wiki/HS_troponin-T_to_rule_out_MI,,
Among women planning to become pregnant does administration of a periconceptual multivitamin reduce neural tube defects when compared a trace-element supplement?,The 1991 MRC Vitamin Study[1] demonstrated that folic acid was effective in secondary prevention in women with prior pregnancy complicated with a neural tube defect (spinal bifida anencephaly and encephalocele)[2] when compared to supplementation with vitamins A D B1 B2 B6 C and nicotinamide. Whether a folic acid-containing multivitamin could be used as primary prevention for neural tube defects was unknown.,/wiki/Hungarian_Prenatal_Vitamin_Trial,,
What is the impact of treating adult patients in severe sepsis or septic shock with a cocktail of intravenous vitamin C thiamine and hydrocortisone?,Sepsis is life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection leading to an imbalance in oxygen demand and supply and is a leading cause of infectious death.[1] Sepsis was originally defined in 1992 via a consensus based definition from SCCM and ACCP defined as a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) with a suspected source of infection. These patients were then stratified into one of three categories:  sepsis severe sepsis (with lactic acidosis or hypotension) or septic shock (severe sepsis with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation).[2] In 2016 these definitions were modified with the Sepsis-3 update the SIRS criteria were eliminated and the SOFA and q-SOFA criteria have now been adopted.[1][3],/wiki/Hydrocortisone,_Vitamin_C,_and_Thiamine_in_Severe_Sepsis_and_Septic_Shock
In patients with severe sepsis does early hydrocortisone therapy reduce progression to septic shock compared to placebo?,Multiple RCTs have investigated the potential role for steroid therapy in patients with septic shock. The Annane Trial in 2002 demonstrated a short-term mortality benefit with IV hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone among patients with evidence of adrenal insufficiency on ACTH stimulation testing. The more recent CORTICUS study investigated hydrocortisone in patients with and without adrenal insufficiency and found no benefit in either subgroup with suggestion of increased infection rates in patients receiving hydrocortisone. Since the patient population in the Annane Trial were more critically ill a benefit to steroid therapy in sicker patients could not be excluded. In addition in both trials shock was more rapidly reversed with the use of corticosteroids. As a result of these conflicting data with possible benefit the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines provide a weak Grade 2C recommendation for the use of IV corticosteroids in septic shock refractory to IV fluids and pressor therapy. ,/wiki/HYPRESS,,
Among very elderly patients with hypertension does active treatment with antihypertensives reduce the rate of fatal or nonfatal stroke when compared with placebo?,Contemporary hypertension trials (including MRC[1] STOP-Hypertension[2] STOP-Hypertension-2[3] and SHEP[4]) have generally excluded the very elderly or have had few enrollees ≥80 years. A 1999 meta-analysis of RCT data found that treatment of hypertension in this age group was associated with a statistically significant reduction in major CV events and HF but no reduction no CV mortaltiy and an increased risk of all-cause mortality.[5] As such the optimal treatment of hypertension in this age group is unclear. ,/wiki/HYVET,,
In patients with acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock does an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) reduce mortality? ,Mortality rates in patients with acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock remain high.  Given the lack of RCTs recommendations for adjunctive therapy in this population have been based on pathophysiological assumptions and expert opinion only.  An intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is an inflatable device placed in the aorta that inflates with diastole and deflates with systole. IABPs are thought to benefit patients in cardiogenic shock by decreasing afterload during systole and increasing coronary perfusion during diastole thereby improving overall myocardial oxygen consumption. The use of IABPs go back to the 1970s; and IABPs are the most widely used mechanical assist devices in hemodynamically unstable patients today. The 2004 ACC/AHA[1] and 2010 ESC STEMI guidelines listed class IB and IC recommendations respectively for the use of IABP in patients with cardiogenic shock despite a lack of RCTs establishing its benefit.,/wiki/IABP-SHOCK_II,,
Do patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer have improved survival with cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy compared to observation alone? ,Surgery chemotherapy and radiation therapy all play a role in the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Particularly for patients with stage 1 and 2 disease surgical resection offers the best chance at a cure. Nevertheless relapse occurs in a substantial portion of patients following complete resection and postoperative chemotherapy may play a role in eradicating micrometastatic disease. Published in 2004 the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) was the first large randomized clinical trial to demonstrate that adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy after complete surgical resection improved 5-year overall survival compared to observation alone. The trial randomized 1867 patients with completely resected stage 1-3 NSCLC to either postoperative chemotherapy or observation alone. Participating centers chose the adjuvant therapy provided and about half of patients received 3-4 cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide. Most patients had undergone pneumonectomy or lobectomy as their cancer surgery and most (90%) had WHO performance status 0-1. Pathologic stage was 1 in about 35% stage 2 in 25% and stage 3 in the remaining 40%. With a median follow-up of 56 months the primary outcome of overall survival favored adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.76-0.98; P=<0.03). As a result of IALT and similar studies adjuvant chemotherapy became the standard of care for patients with resected stage 1-3 disease.,/wiki/IALT,,
What is the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib among patients with previously treated Waldenström macroglobulinemia?,Waldenström macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma WM) is an indolent B-cell lymphoma marked by adenopathy splenomegaly cytopenias and hyperviscosity due to circulating monoclonal IgM antibodies. Treatment generally targets the lymphoplasmacytic cell and front-line options include rituximab monotherapy and combination rituximab plus chemotherapy. Identification of the MYD88L265P mutation and its activation of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathway in the majority of WM patients raised the hypothesis that BTK inhibition with ibrutinib would yield favorable responses.,/wiki/Ibrutinib_in_Waldenstrom_macroglobulinemia,,
In patients 70 years or younger with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) how does the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib-rituximab compare to the chemoimmunotherapy regimen of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituxmiab?,Prior studies established chemoimmunotherapy as the standard-of-care for patients with untreated CLL. This standard was challenged with the introduction of novel agents such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax which proved to be very active and well tolerated in patients with CLL. A head-to-head study of novel therapy versus chemoimmunotherapy was necessary.,/wiki/Ibrutinib-Rituximab_or_Chemoimmunotherapy_for_Chronic_Lymphocytic_Leukemia,,
In patients experiencing their first episode of acute pericarditis does colchicine reduce the rate of incessant or recurrent pericarditis when compared placebo?,'Pericarditis therapies include NSAIDs glucocorticoids and colchicine although few trials exist to guide their use.[1] The unblinded COPE trial (2005)[2] suggested colchicine''s efficacy in the first episode of pericarditis. The blinded CORP trial (2011)[3] demonstrated the benefit of colchicine in recurrent pericarditis. No blinded large RCT using colchicine had been performed in individuals with their first episode of pericarditis however.',/wiki/ICAP,,
In patients with stage V CKD does the initiation of early dialysis improve survival or outcomes?,Previous non-randomized observational studies involving early initiation of dialysis demonstrated mixed results on survival. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study is the only randomized trial that assessed time of dialysis initiation and mortality. This study randomized 828 patients with progressive CKD and GFR between 10-15 ml/min/1.73 m2 to initiation of early dialysis when GFR was 10-14 or late dialysis when GFR was 5-7.  At a median followup of 3.6 years there was no significant difference in survival cardiovascular events infections or dialysis complications between the two arms. ,/wiki/IDEAL,,
Among ICU with septic shock and AKI without urgent need for dialysis does an initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) using an early-initiation strategy reduce all-cause mortality at 90 days when compared to a delayed-initiation strategy?,Sepsis remains one of the most frequent reasons for ICU admissions. The development of AKI in the context of septic shock is well documented with rates ranging between 40-75% [1]. A common dilemma within the ICU in these patients is whether to begin RRT early upon development of severe acute kidney injury or wait until an acute indication for dialysis arises in these patients. Recent clinical evidence is conflicting. The 2016 multicenter AKIKI study compared early- vs. delayed-initiation RRT in general ICU patients about 67% of whom had septic shock. There was no difference 28 and 90 day mortality. In contrast the 2016 single-center ELAIN trial (32% with severe sepsis) found a mortality benefit in general ICU patients with severe AKI (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.97).[2] Of note ELAIN primarily enrolled surgical patients.[3] While there is ongoing debate between these two trials and their methodological differences a focused trial towards severe AKI in sepsis has not been performed.,/wiki/IDEAL-ICU,,
In patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy do irbesartan or amlodipine slow the progression of nephropathy independently of their antihypertensive effect as compared to placebo?,ACE-inhibitors were shown to prevent progression of DM nephropathy in patients with T1DM in the 1993 CSG Captopril Trial. Irbesartan and amlodipine are antihypertensive agents which belong to the categories of angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (ARB) and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCB) respectively. The Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) examined if these agents slow the progression of nephropathy independently of their antihypertensive effect in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).,/wiki/IDNT,,
In patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing revascularization with intermediate coronary lesions is instantaneous wave free ratio (iFR) noninferior to fractional flow reserve (FFR) for PCI guidance with regard to all-cause mortality nonfatal MI or unplanned revascularization?,Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a method of determining the functional significance of an angiographically borderline epicardial coronary lesion in which flow is measured both proximal and distal to a lesion while adenosine is administered in order to induce hyperemia and minimize coronary resistance. When distal flow is ≤ 80% of proximal flow using FFR a coronary lesion is considered physiologically significant. The recent FAME 2 trial demonstrated the superiority of FFR-guided revascularization to standard angiographic guidance in PCI leading to a significant improvement in rate of death nonfatal MI or urgent revascularization driven primarily by a lower rate of urgent revascularization following FFR-guided PCI.,/wiki/IFR-SWEDEHEART,,
Among individuals with ACS does ezetimibe+simvastatin reduce CV mortality major CV event or nonfatal stroke when compared to simvastatin alone?,Ample evidence supports the use of statins for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD and its complications including death. On the other hand evidence supporting the use of ezetimibe a non-statin agent inhibiting small intestinal cholesterol absorption[1] is conflicting. In fact the FDA approved ezetimibe for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in 2002 based upon its effect on LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and not on its impact on cardiovascular outcomes.[2] Subsequent studies demonstrated that the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy reduces LDL-C by an additional ~23%.[3] The industry-sponsored 2008 ENHANCE trial[4] failed to demonstrate slowing of progression of atherosclerotic disease when added to statin therapy. Based upon these and other studies the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines[5] did not include ezetimibe in the treatment algorithm given insufficient evidence for prevention CVD outcomes. A trial demonstrating effectiveness of ezetimibe was needed in order for the medication to remain relevant.,/wiki/IMPROVE-IT,,
Among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis does nintedanib reduce the decline in FVC as compared to placebo?,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a restrictive lung disease characterized by progressive decline in lung function and an high rate of mortality. Prior to this trial treatment options were limited. The combination of azathioprine prednisone and N-acetylcysteine being previously shown to be associated with higher rates of SAE hospitalizations and adverse events in the 2012 PANTHER trial.[1],/wiki/INPULSIS_Trials,,
In patients with asymptomatic HIV infection with CD4+ count >500 cells/mm3 does immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduce the risk of serious events or death compared to deferred initiation until the CD4+ is less than 350 cells/mm3?,The advent of three-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in the 1990s have resulted in remarkable declines in morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients.  In the early 2000s therapy was withheld in HIV-infected patients without AIDS given the toxicity of early potent ART and lack of evidence supporting early initiation in patients with relatively preserved CD4+ counts.  Subsequently randomized studies demonstrated AIDS-related morbidity and mortality benefit with early initiation of ART in patients with CD4+ counts <350.  The evidence for initiating ART in patients with CD4+ counts >350 comes from the START and Temprano trials. ,/wiki/INSIGHT_START,,
In high risk HIV-seronegative males do antiretroviral therapies reduce the rate of HIV seroconversion?,Primary prevention of HIV has been demonstrated among pregnant women with oral AZT in PACTG 076[1] (1999) and among heterosexual women with intravaginal TDF in CAPRISA 004[2] (2010). This is one of the largest primary prevention trial among men.,/wiki/IPrEx,,
Among patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML does imatinib delay disease progression compared to IFNα/cytarabine?,The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) results from a t(9;22) translocation that produces the BCR-ABL protein a tyrosine kinase responsible for cell proliferation that drives CML. Imatinib (STI571) is a selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that has been shown to delay disease progression among individuals in the chronic phase of CML.,/wiki/IRIS,,
In patients with iron deficiency and symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) does oral iron replacement improve exercise capacity?,Iron plays a critical role in oxygen delivery by contributing to the production of red blood cells and serving as a cofactor for enzymes required to perform cellular respiration and maintain vascular homeostasis. Nearly 50% of patients with symptomatic HFrEF have iron deficiency which may impair these processes and prevent adequate compensation for impaired cardiac function. This notion is supported by the finding that regardless of hemoglobin status the presence of iron deficiency in HFrEF has been associated with reduced functional capacity poorer quality of life and increased mortality.[1] Furthermore in the FAIR-HF trial patients with symptomatic HFrEF and iron deficiency (with or without anemia) given IV iron replacement had improvements in functional capacity heart failure symptoms and quality of life. Whether these benefits would extend to the use of inexpensive and readily available oral iron replacement remained unknown.,/wiki/IRONOUT-HF,,
In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) for whom an invasive evaluation is planned is antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor superior to prasugrel with regard to a primary outcome of death nonfatal MI or stroke?,Platelet inhibition using P2Y12 inhibitors (in addition to aspirin) is a cornerstone of contemporary therapy for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The P2Y12 inhibitors most commonly utilized for patients presenting with ACS include clopidogrel ticagrelor and prasugrel. Of the three clopidogrel is the least potent agent with recent randomized trials suggesting that ticagrelor (see PLATO) and prasugrel (see TRITON-TIMI 38) are associated with significant decreases in adverse thrombotic outcomes including cardiovascular death. Whether ticagrelor or prasugrel is preferred over the other with regard to thrombotic and bleeding risk however remained unclear.,/wiki/ISAR-REACT_5,,
In patients requiring oral anticoagulation (OAC) for a separate indication undergoing drug-eluting stent (DES) placement after coronary intervention is six weeks of clopidogrel therapy (in addition to aspirin and OAC) associated with superior net clinical outcome with regard to thrombosis and bleeding compared to 6 months of clopidogrel therapy? ,Dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a thienopyridine is known to be effective in preventing recurrent coronary thrombotic events including the highly morbid and often fatal complication of in-stent thrombosis following placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) during coronary intervention. However the optimal duration of DAPT after DES placement is unclear. Although ACC/AHA guidelines recommend at least 12 months of dual-antiplatelet therapy following DES recent trials such as DAPT and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 suggest that a longer duration of DAPT may be beneficial in reducing late stent thrombosis.[1] Conversely the ISAR-SAFE trial showed that 6 months of DAPT was not associated with increased thrombotic events compared to the usual 1 year.[2],/wiki/ISAR-TRIPLE,,
In patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and moderate to severe ischemia does initial revascularization improve outcomes compared to medical therapy alone?,Despite the negative COURAGE trial in 2007 the use of PCI in patients with stable angina remains a subject of debate. Critics of COURAGE contend that patients with greater ischemic burden — those hypothesized to respond best to PCI — were poorly represented in the study. This prompted a series of studies including BARI 2D evaluating whether specific higher-risk patient subgroups may benefit from PCI. ,/wiki/ISCHEMIA,,
In patients with suspected acute MI what is separate and combined effect of streptokinase and of aspirin in decreasing the risk of vascular mortality?,During the 1960s and 1970s several small trials of fibrinolytic therapy involving mainly IV streptokinase were performed. Meta-analysis suggested that fibrinolytic therapy for acute MI could reduce vascular mortality by 25%. The large GISSI trial (1986) prospectively studied this and demonstrated that high-dose streptokinase effectively dissolves thrombi and recanalizes occluded coronary arteries.,/wiki/ISIS-2,,
In patients with acute ischemic stroke what is the efficacy of aspirin and of subcutaneous heparin in decreasing morbidity and mortality?,IST and Chinese Acute Stroke Trial[1] (1997) trials are two of the largest trials to study aspirin in acute ischemic stroke. The International Stroke Trial (IST) demonstrated a 28% reduction in 14-day recurrence of ischemic stroke and a 9% reduction in the combined outcome of nonfatal stroke or death at 14 days. This was similar to CAST which demonstrated a 14% reduction in all-cause mortality at 4 weeks. Together IST and CAST demonstrated that aspirin led to a reduction of 11 nonfatal strokes or deaths per 1000 patients in the first few weeks among patients with acute ischemic stroke with a NNT of 91.,/wiki/IST,,
In patients with normal LDL and elevated high-sensitivity CRP (HS-CRP) does rosuvastatin reduce the incidence of major CV events?,Multiple trials (including HPS WOSCOPS TNT LIPID CARE  4S and PROVE IT-TIMI 22) have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in primary and secondary prevention of CV events among patients with hyperlipidemia or known CAD respectively. However the role of statins for patients with elevated inflammatory markers which have been linked to occult CAD had not been well studied until the JUPITER trial.,/wiki/JUPITER,,
Among patients with untreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 expression and without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements does pembrolizumab improve progression-free survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy?,Recent years have seen the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of multiple malignancies. These agents improve the ability of the immune system to recognize and kill tumor cells. The first approved checkpoint inhibitor was ipilimumab a monoclonal antibody targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in the treatment of melanoma.[1] Further studies demonstrated that targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis using fully humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 (pembrolizumab nivolumab) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab) was more effective than chemotherapy in first-line metastatic melanoma[2] second-line advanced renal cell carcinoma[3] second-line advanced nonsquamous NSCLC[4] recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck[5] and had significant responses in second-line advanced urothelial carcinoma[6] and refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.[7],/wiki/KEYNOTE-024,,
Among patients with T2DM at increased risk for CV events does daily liraglutide reduce CV mortality nonfatal MI or nonfatal strokes when compared to placebo?,The global prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise from an estimated 2.8% (171 million) to 4.4% (366 million) in 2030.[1] Diabetes is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several large scale glucose-lowering medication trials including PROactive (2005) EXAMINE (2013)[2] SAVOR-TIMI 53 (2013)[3] TECOS (2015) and ELIXA (2015)[4] and the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention trial (2013) have disappointingly failed to show a significant reduction in CV events. UKPDS 34 (1998) and SPREAD-DIMCAD (2013)[5] showed reduction in CVD events with metformin. Similarly the 2015 EMPA-REG OUTCOME found a CVD benefit with empaglifozin an SGLT-2 inhibitor.,/wiki/LEADER,,
Among patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma does early treatment with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone improve progression-free survival compared to observation?,"Multiple myeloma is a plasma-cell malignancy that leads to characteristic features of hypercalcemia renal dysfunction anemia and lytic bone disease. Observational studies revealed that nearly all patients diagnosed with myeloma have a prephase of disease starting with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and progressing to asymptomatic (""smoldering"") multiple myeloma over a period of years. Efforts to delay symptomatic progression and death have focused on early initiation of therapy for patients with these precursor conditions.

Among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and associated pain does an epidural injection of a glucocorticoid plus lidocaine reduce disability and leg pain at six weeks when compared to an injection of lidocaine alone?,"Epidural administration of glucocorticoids is widely used for symptomatic relief in patients with spinal stenosis though the therapy has not been evaluated in a large randomized trial. A 2013 Cochrane review classified the existing evidence for epidural injections in this disease as ""very low quality"" and identified an urgent need for clinical trials.[1]",/wiki/LESS,,
In surgical ICU patients how does intensive compare to conventional glycemic control in reducing mortality?,The single center Leuven Surgical Trial in 2001 so named because it took place in the Belgian city and involved predominantly surgical patients randomized 1548 surgical ICU patients to intensive glycemic control (goal glucose 80-110 mg/dL) vs. conventional glycemic control (180-200 mg/dL).  This trial demonstrated a significantly lower ICU mortality in the intensive glycemic control arm particularly among patients who were in the ICU for 5 days or longer.  This mortality benefit was not replicated in the same Leuven center in medical ICU patients in the 2006 Leuven Medical Trial.,/wiki/Leuven_Surgical_Trial,,
Among patients with low/intermediate-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia how does combination ATRA plus arsenic trioxide compare to conventional therapy with ATRA plus chemotherapy?,Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for about 10% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases and is associated with severe DIC and early death. Traditionally it had been treated with chemotherapy similar to other cases of AML. Advances in the molecular understanding of APL identified the t(15;17) translocation as the sine qua non of APL. This translocation results in the PML-RARA fusion product leading to the arrest of myeloid differentiation and the clinical phenotype of APL. In the 1980s studies demonstrated that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could reverse this maturation block and clinical investigations demonstrated that single-agent ATRA was associated with hematologic complete responses (CR) in 85% of patients with APL. The finding that arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces apoptosis in APL blasts prompted the development of chemotherapy-free regimens including ATRA-ATO which delivered CR in >90% of patients in initial studies. Additionally it was hypothesized that ATRA-ATO may be associated with less treatment-related toxicity. This landmark study was carried out to compare ATRA-ATO and ATRA-chemotherapy and determine whether patients with APL could be cured without chemotherapy.,/wiki/Lo-Coco_2013,,
In patients with clinically stable coronary disease does taking colchicine 0.5 mg/day as compared to no colchicine reduce the risk of cardiovascular events? ,A retrospective study published in 2012 demonstrated a lower incidence of MI in patients with gout on colchicine[1] although a randomized prospective trial was lacking.,/wiki/LoDoCo,,
In patients with chronic coronary disease does colchicine improve cardiovascular outcomes?,'The anti-inflammatory medication Colchicine was postulated to have cardioprotective effects after a retrospective analysis found that patients with gout treated with colchicine had a lower rate of myocardial infarction.[1]  Prior studies had demonstrated that inflammation increased patient''s risk of cardiovascular events and the 2019 CANTOS study found improved cardiovascular outcomes with the immunosuppressant  canakinumab. The 2013 Low-Dose Colchicine (LoDoCo) trial randomized patients with stable CAD to colchicine or usual care with improved cardiovascular outcomes particularly ACS. The trial was open label and criticized for its lack of placebo control and blinding to treatment group. Additionally patients were added to the treatment group to replace patients that dropped out of the trial. More recently interest in colchicine''s cardioprotective effects have garnered renewed interest after the 2019 Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT) in patients with recent myocardial infarction randomized patients to colchicine vs placebo and found a reduced risk of cardiovascular outcomes.',/wiki/LoDoCo2,,
Among overweight or obese patients with T2DM does moderate weight loss and increased exercise reduce CVD and its complications?,T2DM confers increased risk for development of CVD.

Among patients with HF with LVEF ≤30% and QRS duration ≥130 msec does placement of an ICD with cardiac resynchronization therapy reduce mortality or HF events when compared to ICD placement alone?,The benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for patients with LVEF ≤35% cardiac dyssynchrony and NYHA class III or IV symptoms was demonstrated by the 2002 MIRACLE and 2005 CARE-HF trials.The role of ICD plus CRT for patients with milder symptoms was less well established.,/wiki/MADIT-CRT,,
In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy does prophylactic ICD placement improve survival?,The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT-II) randomized 1232 post-MI patients with systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤30%) to prophylactic ICD or conventional medical therapy. Unlike the earlier MADIT-I (1996) and MUSTT (1999) trials MADIT-II did not require electrophysiologic testing for inducible VT prior to enrollment. After a mean follow-up of 20 months the trial was terminated early because prophylactic ICD reduced all-cause mortality (14.2% vs. 19.8%; P=0.016; NNT=18). A post-hoc analysis demonstrated that the mortality reduction appeared to be entirely attributed to a reduction in SCD (3.8% vs. 10.0%; P<0.01)[1].  The reason is not entirely clear but ICD placement was also associated with a higher rate of heart failure (20% vs. 15%).,/wiki/MADIT-II,,
In patients admitted to the hospital with an acute medical illness is short-course rivaroxaban non-inferior to short-course enoxaparin in preventing VTE or its complications without increasing bleeding? Also is extended-course rivaroxaban superior to short-course enoxaparin in preventing VTE or its complications without increasing bleeding?,Guidelines recommend LMWH unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized non-surgical patients at increased risk for clot development.[1] The role of rivaroxaban a direct factor Xa inhibitor is unknown in prevention of VTE and its complications in this population. RECORD1[2] and RECORD3[3] (both published 2008) demonstrated efficacy of short-course rivaroxaban over short-course enoxaparin in prevention of VTE after hip and knee replacements respectively. These interventions were not associated with increased rates of bleeding. Interestingly RECORD2[4] (2008) demonstrated that extended-course rivaroxaban was more effective in preventing VTE than short-course enoxaparin without increasing bleeding rates following hip replacement. The efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban as a VTE prophylactic in acute illness was unknown.,/wiki/MAGELLAN,,
Among high-risk medically ill patients does anticoagulation with rivaroxaban 10 mg PO qday reduce the posthospital discharge rate of symptomatic or fatal venous thromboembolism when compared with placebo?,Patients hospitalized with an acute medical illness may have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) that persists for several weeks after hospital discharge.  Anticoagulant prophylaxis reduces VTE during hospitalizations and after high-risk surgeries with rivaroxaban 10 mg PO qday reducing incident VTE in RECORD1[1] and RECORD2[2] for hip and knee replacements respectively.[3] The role for post-hospitalization prophylaxis following higher-risk medical admissions is of unclear clinical utility and guidelines recommend against prolonging the duration of anticoagulation beyond the period of immobilization or hospitalization in view of limited data and unclear net benefit.[3][4],/wiki/MARINER,,
What is the long term mortality benefit and cost effectiveness of screening men 65-74 for abdominal aortic aneurysms? ,Men older than 65 are at a increased risk for death from ruptured AAA.[1] US is a potentantial modality for non-invasive screening for AAA which may reduce mortality through preventive surgical repair. Results of a 1995 pilot study indicated the feasibility of population screening by US.[2] A large clinical trial demonstrating efficacy of the intervention was needed. ,/wiki/MASS,,
In patients with recent ischemic CVA or TIA does clopidogrel plus aspirin reduce recurrent events when compared to clopidogrel alone?,'The evidence-based use of aspirin in cerebrovascular disease was initially based upon early trials such as IST (1997) and Chinese Acute Stroke Trial[1] (1997) which demonstrated a clear benefit of the antiplatelet agent in secondary prevention of ischemic CVA and TIA. This was confirmed in the 2002 Antithrombotic Trialists'' Collaboration meta-analysis.[2] The use of clopidogrel was initially based upon extrapolation from studies of CAD and then from direct study in the CAPRIE trial (1996). CURE (2001) and CREDO[3] (2002) demonstrated a clear benefit of combination therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel compared to aspirin alone in CAD but combination therapy had not yet been studied in cerebrovascular disease.

Among critically ill patients with hypoactive or hyperactive delirium does administration of the antipsychotic medications haloperidol or ziprasidone improve the number of days alive without delirium or coma when compared to placebo?,The incidence of delirium within the ICU has been cited to be 30% however can reach much higher incidences in certain ICU populations particularly in conjunction with organ failure or mechanical ventilation.[1] Delirium similar to non-ICU patients is associated with increased mortality prolonged mechanical ventilation and prolonged ICU stays.[2] Many trials to date have looked at the use of antipsychotic therapy in both prevention of delirium as well as reducing the length of delirium.HOPE-ICU (2013) tested haloperidol a typical antipsychotic in preventing delirium without evidence of shortening duration or incidence of delirium.[3] A pilot study by Devlin et al. (2010) identified the potential for the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine to reduce duration of delirium and increase rates of hospital discharge when added to haloperidol.[4] Given these varied findings the role of antipsychotic therapy in management of ICU-related delirium was unclear. ,/wiki/MIND-USA,,
In patients with UA/NSTEMI does early treatment with atorvastatin reduce rates of early CV events when compared with placebo?,The use of statins had previously been shown to reduce mortality from chronic cardiovascular disease.

Among patients with empyema does the combination of tPA and DNAse improve resolution of pleural loculation as evidenced by radiographic pleural fluid density?,'Parapneumonic effusions and empyema are significant sources of morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics have difficulty penetrating the fibrinopurulent phase of pleural space infections. Video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with decortication and washout are the gold standard for suitable candidates however the procedure is invasive and many patients are not operative candidates. The investigation of intrapleural agents therefore are of interest as an additional treatment modality. However the 2005 MIST1 study[1] found no clinical benefit from infusion of the fibrinolytic streptokinase into the infected pleural fluid collection. Streptokinase''s fibrinolytic activity is systemic while tPA''s fibrinolysis tends to be more localized to thrombi which might drive more effective lysis of pathological thrombi which might be advantageous in degrading the loculations in pleural infections.[2] DNase degrades DNA and reduces the viscosity of fluids with breakdown products of bacteria.[3] Use of a DNase agent might also improve locular breakdown in pleural infections without compounding the bleeding risk associated with thrombolytics. Whether either of these agents improves outcomes in pleural infections was unresolved.',/wiki/MIST2,,
Among patients receiving oral antibiotics for primary or recurrent C. difficile infection does actoxumab or bezlotoxumab reduce the rate of recurrent infection as compared to placebo.?,Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) may recur in up to one-third of patients after completing initial therapy.[1][2] Different therapies have been evaluated for the prevention of CDI recurrence including probiotics fidaxomicin and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Fidaxomicin has been shown to reduce recurrence rate as compared to vancomycin (16.9% vs 29.2%; P = 0.048).[3] However its cost-effectiveness has been debated.[4] As discussed in a recent review the recurrence rate associated with fidaxomicin treatment remains suboptimal (>10%).[5] Recent reviews and guidelines have concluded that there are insufficient data to recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of recurrent CDI.[6][7][8][9] FMT has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrence rates however many questions including administration route and candidate selection remains to be addressed.[10][11][5] The annual economic burden of CDI is estimated to be more than $496 million in the US.[12] A study in 2014 also showed that C. difficile was the most common pathogen isolated in healthcare-associated infections (12.1%).[13] Given the burden of CDI there is an urgent need to identify effective additional effective therapies for its secondary prevention.,/wiki/MODIFY_I_and_II,,
In patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical management referred for durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement is a magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow device superior to an axial-flow device with regard to reoperation for device malfunction or disabling stroke?,"LVADs are proven effective both for providing temporary support to patients awaiting cardiac transplant (termed ""bridge to transplant"") as well as durably improving survival and quality of life in patients who are not transplant candidates (termed ""destination therapy"" see REMATCH and HEARTMATE II). Since the original REMATCH trial LVAD technology has improved with transition from first-generation pulsatile-flow devices to second-generation continuous-flow devices which were shown in HEARTMATE II to be associated with fewer mechanical failures and disabling strokes. Nevertheless even second-generation continuous flow devices are susceptible to mechanical complications such as pump thrombosis which often results in need for reoperation. Magnetically levitated centrifugal-flow devices may improve upon the earlier axial-flow design by using a magnetic induction motor to generate flow centrifugally allowing for wide blood-flow paths and intrinsic pulsatility factors that may reduce pump thrombosis rates. In a 6-month analysis of the HeartMate III centrifugal-flow device there was an absence of pump thrombosis compared to a 10.1% rate observed with second-generation axial-flow LVADs.[1] Whether this difference persists in longer-term follow up or is associated with clinical events remained unproven.",/wiki/MOMENTUM_3,,
Among patients with submassive PE does low-dose tPA reduce the incidence of pulmonary hypertension or recurrent PE when compared to anticoagulation alone?,Thrombolysis with intravenous tPA is a standard treatment for acute massive PE.[1] However among patients with submassive PE namely those who are hemodynamically stable but have signs of RV dysfunction the selection of patients who may benefit from thrombolysis remains elusive. tPA has rarely been used in the latter population where the benefit of thrombolysis has not clearly been demonstrated to outweigh the risk of major bleeding. The MAPPET-3 trial[2] (2002) compared heparin therapy with either tPA or placebo in patients with submassive PE and found that tPA reduced a composite endpoint of in-hospital all-cause mortality or clinical decompensation requiring further intervention. However no survival benefit was seen an observation attributed in part to the excess in bleeding risk associated with tPA. Low-dose tPA may reduce this bleeding risk while retaining efficacy although this hypothesis had not been formally tested.,/wiki/MOPETT,,
In patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) does arthroscopic debridement or lavage reduce knee pain at two years?,Arthroscopic interventions have been widely used for the treatment of symptomatic knee OA but the practice is controversial because its efficacy has not been clearly established in clinical trials.[1] The Moseley Trial randomized 180 predominantly white male patients with symptomatic and radiographic evidence of knee OA to arthroscopic debridement arthroscopic lavage or sham arthroscopy performed by a single orthopedic surgeon in Texas.  At two years there was no difference in pain and function between the arthroscopic interventions and sham surgery. ,/wiki/Moseley_Trial,,
Among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma being treated with first-line chemotherapy for metastatic disease does gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel prolong overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone?,'Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy and patients with metastatic disease have an overall dismal prognosis. Traditional chemotherapeutic therapies may be ineffective because of the hypovascular and desmoplastic nature of the tumor''s stroma.[1] For many years a standard of care was elusive; eventually gemcitabine was compared to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and demonstrated an overall survival advantage (5.6 vs. 4.4 months).[2] Improved outcomes were seen with leucovorin 5-fluorouracil irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) in the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study which resulted in an overall survival benefit when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy (11.1 vs. 6.8 months; P <0.001).[3] This regimen was found to be fairly toxic and subsequent efforts sought to reduce toxicity while improving on the efficacy of gemcitabine monotherapy.

In patients with large proximal anterior circulation strokes does intra-arterial (IA) intervention in addition to usual care offer improved neurological outcomes? ,Large artery occlusions of the proximal anterior circulation (involving the ICA M1 M2 A1 A2) accounts for about one-third of anterior ischemic strokes.[1] However conventional IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy is able to achieve recanalization in perhaps only a fifth of patients with proximal arterial occlusions and perhaps only in under 5% of patients with ICA occlusions.[2] Unfortunately the remainder of these patients typically go on to have poor functional prognoses. ,/wiki/MR_CLEAN,,
In patients with acute ischemic stroke does the presence of viable ischemic brain tissue on neuroimaging identify those most likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy?,Few studies have provided support for penumbral-imaging selection for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (including DEFUSE[1] DEFUSE2[2] and EPITHET[3]). However there was no RCT showing that patients selected for revascularization on the basis of penumbral-imaging pattern had better clinical outcomes than patients treated medically or those with unfavorable penumbral imaging pattern.,/wiki/MR_RESCUE,,
In high-risk male patients does a multi-factor intervention program decrease mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) as compared to usual medical care?,"In the 1970s as it still is today[1] CVD (including CHD) was a leading cause of death among US adults. The seminal Framingham Heart Study identified the ""conventional"" risk factors for CHD including smoking elevated cholesterol and elevated BP.[2] Whether modifying these risk factors reduced CHD deaths was unknown. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) was a seminal clinical trial in CHD risk prevention that randomized 12866 men between 35 to 57 years old with high risk of death from CHD to receive a multi-factor ""special intervention"" (SI) program or usual medical care. Participants received 1. Smoking cessation counseling 2. BP lowering with antihypertensives and 3. Cholesterol lowering through dietary counseling. The 7-year results did not show any benefit of the multi-factor intervention program on mortality from CHD as compared to usual medical care possibly because of lower-than-expected CHD events. Further analyses later found a reduction in a combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events. ",/wiki/MRFIT,,
In adults with sickle-cell disease who have ≥3 crises per year does hydroxyurea decrease the frequency of sickle-cell crises as compared to placebo?,In patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) a mutation in the beta chain of hemoglobin yields abnormal hemoglobin polymerization red-cell sickling and reduced capillary blood flow that leads to a variety of complications including painful crises. Fetal hemoglobin (Hgb F) is a form of hemoglobin that does not require the beta globin chain and in patients with SCD increasing its synthesis can decrease red-cell sickling. Hydroxyurea increases Hgb F synthesis[1] and this study tested its use in patients with SCD.,/wiki/MSH,,
In patients ischemic cardiomyopathy EF≤40% and asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia does an EPS-guided approach (including ICD and/or antiarrhythmic drugs) reduce the risk of cardiac arrest or arrhythmic death compared to no intervention?,Multiple RCTs including SCD-HeFT and MADIT-II have established the role of ICD use as primary prophylaxis to reduce arrhythmic mortality in patients with significant systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35% with symptoms in SCD-HeFT and LVEF ≤ 30% in the setting of ischemic cardiomyopathy regardless of symptoms in MADIT-II). Other patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy particularly those who experience nonsustained VT are thought to remain at higher risk of arrhythmic events. This is a large population of patients many of whom will never experience a significant arrhythmic event. It was thought that the use of EPS-guided therapy or the attempted induction of sustained VT by delivering provocative stimuli may be able to identify a subset of patients at higher risk and therefore more likely to benefit from ICD or AAD use versus those with negative induction testing.,/wiki/MUSTT,,
In asymptomatic patients with HIV does early versus deferred initiation of antiretroviral therapy result in a difference in mortality?,With the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) HIV has now largely become a chronic disease.

In patients with symptomatic stenosis does CEA reduce risk of death or stroke?,Prior studies had demonstrated the benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with severe carotid stenosis but NASCET was the first large well-designed trial to study CEA in patients with low-moderate (<50%) high-moderate (50-69%) and severe (≥70%) stenosis. Those with symptomatic 50-69% stenosis had a 29% reduction in the 5-year risk of death or stroke while those with <50% stenosis had no such benefit. Those with ≥70% stenosis received such a dramatic benefit that this study arm was prematurely stopped and all patients with severe stenosis were subsequently referred for CEA.,/wiki/NASCET,,
Among ESRD patients how do HD duration and target BUN affect death and hospitalization rates?,"The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) was the first randomized trial of hemodialysis ""dose"".

In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF LVEF ≥ 50%) and mild-moderate (NYHA II-III) symptoms does the long-acting nitrate isosorbide mononitrate improve activity tolerance versus placebo?,Although they have never been demonstrated to improve mortality in any cardiac condition long-acting nitrates clearly provide symptomatic benefit in patients with angina. Furthermore several small randomized trials have suggested that long-acting nitrates also improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) presumably by improving cardiac filling pressures and hemodynamics.[1][2] As a result these drugs are commonly used for symptom control in HFrEF.,/wiki/NEAT-HFpEF,,
Among patients with severe bilateral emphysema does lung volume reduction surgery improve survival or level of function when compared to medical therapy alone? ,Hyperinflation of emphysematous lung results in worsening exercise tolerance shortness of breath worsening QOL and mortality.[1] Surgical resection of affected lung tissue is thought to allow expansion of less damaged lung. This restores more normal lung function with symptom improvement and a potential mortality benefit.[2] A small randomized trial of lung-volume-reduction surgery (LVRS) by Geddes et al. (2000) demonstrated that an improved functional outcome though no mortality benefit.[3] A large randomized trial was needed to further validate the intervention.,/wiki/NETT,,
In critically ill patients how does intensive compare to conventional glycemic control in reducing the risk of mortality? ,The impact of glycemic control on inpatient mortality has been long debated. The 2001 Leuven Surgical Trial[1] was one of the first to demonstrate a mortality benefit among predominantly surgical ICU patients treated with intensive glycemic control (targeting a blood glucose of 80-110 mg/dL 4.4-6.1 mmol/L). This mortality benefit with intensive glycemic control was not replicated in the same Belgian center among medical ICU patients in the 2006 Leuven Medical Trial.,/wiki/NICE-SUGAR,,
In patients with ischemic stroke does the administration of tPA reduce morbidity and mortality?,Prior pilot studies suggested that tPA was beneficial when treatment was begun within 3 hours of stroke onset but the 1995 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study (NINDS) was the first to establish efficacy of thrombolysis within a 3-hour time frame for ischemic stroke. The NINDS trial demonstrated improvements in functional outcomes at 3 months if thrombolysis was administered within 3 hours of symptom onset with the greatest benefit seen within 90 minutes. Despite a tenfold increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) there was no significant difference in mortality among those receiving tPA. These results were confirmed in ATLANTIS A[1] (2002).,/wiki/NINDS,,
Among patients at high risk for lung cancer do low-dose screening CT scans reduce mortality when compared to screening CXRs?,Until recently no major practice guidelines have supported lung cancer screening among the general population. However as lung cancer leads among the cancer-related deaths in the US several studies have investigated the role of screening high-risk populations. Several early studies compared CXR to usual care without success. The controversial I-ELCAP trial (2006) successfully detected early lung cancers in smokers using CT scanning although it lacked a control group. Following the development of low-dose CT scanning using one-fifth of the usual CT radiation trials like LSS (2005) and DEPISCAN (2007) demonstrated feasibility of a large screening trial with low-dose CT using CXR as control.,/wiki/NLST,,
In patients with stable or unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are contemporary second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) superior to contemporary bare-metal stents (BMS) with regard to all-cause mortality or nonfatal MI?,Multiple RCTs have demonstrated the superiority of drug-eluting stents (DES) coronary stents that provide continuous local delivery of pharmacologic inhibitors of neointimal proliferation over traditional bare-metal stents (BMS) particularly with regard to stent restenosis or late stent blockage due to endothelial growth within the stent.[1][2] As a result implantation of DES has become the preferred method of coronary intervention even though the risk of late stent thrombosis (acute formation of clot within the stent a rare but devastating outcome) appeared slightly higher with 1st generation DES compared to BMS.[3]. Subsequently however 2nd generation DES was developed representing incremental improvement over 1st generation DES with structural advances allowing for improved outcomes overall as well as a lower risk of late stent thrombosis over 1st generation DES.[4] At the same time however BMS technology had also gradually improved despite these stents usually being placed primarily in patients at higher risk of bleeding (due to the perceived need of a shorter duration of dual antiplatelet therapy due to the original studies demonstrating high risk of late stent thrombosis with DES). Prior to NORSTENT a contemporary trial comparing 2nd generation DES with contemporary BMS was needed in order to determine comparative efficacy and safety particularly with regards to stent thrombosis.,/wiki/NORSTENT,,
Does continuous oxygen therapy reduce mortality in patients with COPD and hypoxemia when compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy?,Therapies for COPD that were few in the 1960s and included antibiotics theophylline ephedrine the mucolytic potassium iodide and phlebotomy.[1] A trial by Levine and colleagues in 1967 suggested benefit of oxygen therapy for patients with COPD and hypoxemia[2] though a larger multicenter trial to evaluate for optimal oxygen therapy frequency and a potential mortality benefit had not been performed.,/wiki/NOTT,,
In patients with mild asthma treated only with as-needed asthma does budesonide+formoterol reliever therapy used as-needed reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations compared to albuterol as-needed?,Prior to Novel START trial asthma guidelines recommend ICS for maintenance therapy in patients with more than intermittent asthma (SABA therapy >2 days per week). Unfortunately many patients find it difficult to use corticosteroids daily.[1] The 2018 SYGMA 1[2] and  SYGMA 2 trials[3] compared various combinations of ICS LABA and SABA agents in double-blinded fashion. SYGMA 1 compared SABA PRN (terbutaline) versus ICS+LABA PRN (budesonide+formoterol) versus ICS BID+SABA PRN (budesonide terbutaline). It found similar rates of severe asthma exacerbation between the ICS+LABA PRN and ICS BID+SABA PRN groups both of which were lower than the SABA PRN group. SYGMA 2 compared ICS+LABA PRN (budesonide+formoterol) versus ICS BID+SABA PRN (budesonide terbutaline) among adults with mild asthma eligible for ICS. ICS+LABA PRN was noninferior in controlling severe asthma exacerbations but came with worse overall symptom control. ,/wiki/Novel_START,,
In women with clinically node-negative breast cancer how does sentinel lymph node biopsy compare to axillary lymph node dissection in terms of overall survival?,Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgical technique used to screen for metastasis in which the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) draining a tumor bed are identified using dye and radioactive tracers. Given the hierarchical anatomy of lymph nodes more distant nodes are almost guaranteed to be negative for tumor when SLNs are negative obviating the need for more extensive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Originally devised for melanoma SLNB remains a major advancement towards reducing the surgical morbidity associated with ALND in women with breast cancer.  Several smaller studies have demonstrated no survival difference between SLNB and ALND but NSABP B-32 was the largest trial to validate the SLNB technique.,/wiki/NSABP_B-32,,
Does tamoxifen reduce the incidence of breast cancer among women with an increased risk for breast cancer?,The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen enhances the effects of estrogen on the uterus bone and coagulation system but selectively blocks the effects of estrogen in the breast. It was first FDA-approved for use in women with breast cancer in 1977 and its effects in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were first demonstrated in the 1989 NSABP B-14 trial. Despite this long track record in breast cancer treatment its role in the primary prevention of breast cancer had not yet been studied.,/wiki/NSABP_P-1,,
Among patients with NSTE-ACS is fondaparinux non-inferior to enoxaparin in preventing death myocardial infarction or refractory ischemia?,The benefit of anticoagulant agents in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with NSTE-ACS was first demonstrated in multiple trials conducted in the 1990s using unfractionated heparin (UFH). Subsequent studies using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in NSTE-ACS compared against UFH in mostly medically managed (e.g. TIMI 11B FRISC) and invasively managed (e.g. SYNERGY A to Z) populations demonstrated an overall further reduction in 10% in death or MI.[1] Despite the efficacy of both these agents however major bleeding remained a major concern with treatment.,/wiki/OASIS-5,,
Among stable high risk patients presenting with subacute myocardial infarction (3-28 days prior) with poor or absent flow of the affected artery does late PCI+optimal medical therapy reduce mortality MI or NYHA class IV HF symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy?,The open artery hypothesis suggests reperfusion of the infarct-related artery salvages myocardium and preserves LV function thereby increasing survival[1]. Early reperfusion in the setting of acute MI is proven to improve mortality as shown in ISIS-2 (1988) GUSTO (1993) and numerous other trials. However some patients present outside the acute window of intervention or otherwise fail to meet indications for thrombolysis and have persistently occluded coronary arteries. Prior to this trial several observational studies suggested a mortality benefit with late reperfusion as a result of reduced infarct expansion and LV remodeling. PCI the current gold standard for establishing reperfusion can lead to harmful periprocedural complications including perforations distal embolization and MI. Given the paucity of data to guide management the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) enrolled patients with recent MI (3-28 days prior) to test the hypothesis that a strategy of late PCI would provide a mortality benefit in patients presenting late after a STEMI. ,/wiki/OAT,,
Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events does the addition of the PCSK-9 inhibitor alirocumab to high-intensity statin therapy reduce LDL cholesterol levels versus placebo?,Multiple studies including the landmark 4S trial have established statins as standard of care in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among high-risk patients. Although statins may work via multiple mechanisms slowing endogenous cholesterol production through inhibition HMG-CoA reductase with resultant LDL lowering is thought to be the primary means by which statin therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes. The recent IMPROVE-IT trial demonstrated that additional LDL reduction with ezetimibe added to statin therapy results in incremental improvement in cardiovascular outcomes suggesting that further reduction of LDL cholesterol levels may optimize cardiovascular risk. ,/wiki/ODYSSEY_LONG_TERM,,
In patients with actively bleeding peptic ulcers what is the effect of intravenous omeprazole on bleeding recurrence after endoscopic treatment?,Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have long been the mainstays of gastric acid suppression and stood as a staple in the management of GI hemorrhage. This study sought to investigate the efficacy of the intravenous PPI omeprazole in reducing rebleeding risk among patients with endoscopically-defined active GI hemorrhage. It enrolled 240 predominantly male patients with GI hemorrhage who underwent early EGD demonstrating actively bleeding ulcer or nonbleeding ulcer with visible vessel and randomized to intravenous omepraozle or placebo. Omeprazole reduced the 30-day risk of rebleeding by 70% compared with placebo; it also reduced the need for blood transfusion and was associated with a shorter hospitalization.,/wiki/Omeprazole_in_Peptic_Ulcer_Bleeding,,
In patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with complications is telmisartan non-inferior to ramipril and is the combination of both drugs superior to ramipril alone for the composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes myocardial infarction stroke or hospitalization for heart failure.,"The efficacy of ACE inhibitors in patients with CV disease and stroke has been demonstrated in multiple trials including SOLVD (1991 HF) SAVE (1992 post-MI) HOPE (2000 high-CV risk) and EUROPA (2003 stable CAD)[1] Of these HOPE studied the most heterogeneous population. As inhibition of angiotensinogen II may be incomplete ARBs may provide an additional benefit through further blockade of the RAAS system to counter this ""escape phenomenon.""[2] No large RCT had been performed demonstrating efficacy of ARBs against or with ACE inhibitors for individuals at high risk for CV disease.",/wiki/ONTARGET,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation are there more risks associated with the use of aspirin plus oral anticoagulation therapy versus anticoagulation therapy alone?,AF was first identified as a risk factor for stroke in a 1978 Framingham study publication.[1][2] The 1991 SPAF[3] study demonstrated that AF was an independent risk factor for stroke and that warfarin was superior to aspirin for stroke prevention. Many patients with AF are treated with aspirin without a compelling indication or fail to meet the USPSTF recommendation[4] for aspirin to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. There have been few studies to determine if patients are subjected to increased bleeding risks when treated with aspirin plus oral anticoagulation therapy as opposed to oral anticoagulation therapy alone for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events.,/wiki/ORBIT-AF,,
In patients with stable angina despite medical therapy and single-vessel disease does PCI improve angina as measured by treadmill exercise time compared to placebo procedure?,Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is commonly utilized for stable angina although evidence for its use is questionable. The previous COURAGE trial randomized patients with stable angina to either PCI or medical therapy and found no difference with regard to myocardial infarction and death. There was a suggestion that patients who received PCI were more likely to be free of angina with a higher quality of life at 6 months although this benefit disappeared by 36 months. Meta-analyses including COURAGE and other similar trials have also failed to demonstrate a clear benefit to PCI in patients with stable angina. [1] As a result of these findings current consensus guidelines recommend medical therapy as first-line for treatment of stable angina but continue to support the use of PCI in patients with obstructive coronary disease who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy. [2] Notably these previous trials have not blinded patients to treatment allocation raising the question of whether symptomatic improvement related to placebo effect. A large randomized placebo-controlled trial of PCI in stable angina was needed to further elucidate these issues.,/wiki/ORBITA,,
Among those with prediabetes or diabetes does supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce CV mortality when compared to placebo?,Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) include linolenic acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Linolenic acid comes from vegetable sources like soybeans canola oils and nuts while EPA and DHA are fish oils.[1] Interest in n-3 PUFAs for prevention of CVD began in the 1970s when observational studies found that the Inuit people of Greenland who consumed a very high amount of fish had low LDL-cholesterol high HDL-cholesterol high levels of EPA and low incidence of CVD. These individuals also had a low serum level of the n-6 PUFA arachadonic acid (AA). It was theorized that a high ratio of n-3:n-6 PUFAs would be beneficial given the lower activity of prostacyclin and subsequent reduced risk of platelet aggregation.[2][3] Early observational studies and comparative trials in the pre-aspirin era yielded conflicting results for the effects of fish-based n-3 PUFA in CVD.[1][4] More recently the 1999 GISSI-Prevenzione trial[5] found a reduction in all-cause mortality MI and stroke when n-3 PUFAs were given to men with CVD. However the GISSI study was limited by high dropout and its open-label design.[4] As such the role of n-3 PUFA in individuals at high risk for CVD remained unclear. ,/wiki/ORIGIN_n-3_Fatty_Acids,,
In patients is moderate to severe early ARDS does high-frequency oscillatory ventilation reduce in-hospital mortality?,'The high mortality rates of ARDS have been improved upon by the ARDSNet trial''s (2000) protocol of low VT (6 mL/kg) and has become standard of care in ICUs. Development of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was thought to further improve survival through prevention of atelectrauma given its ability to deliver even smaller VT of 1-2 mL/kg delivered at 3-15 breaths per second.[1] Early trials on HFOV like MOAT[2] (2002) indicated a potential benefit for the therapy though interpretation of the results was muddled by lack of comparison of HFOV to a modern low VT strategy.',/wiki/OSCILLATE,,
In adult patients with bone or joint infection requiring at least 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy is treatment with oral antibiotics non-inferior to intravenous therapy for the first 6 weeks of treatment?,Managing bone and joint infections usually requires weeks of intravenous antibiotics.

In patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum-based anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody does durvalumab as a consolidation therapy improve progression-free survival or overall survival?,Several small and large randomized trials in diabetics had previously suggested a sizable benefit of tight glycemic control in reducing cardiovascular risk. The ACCORD trial was the largest study of its kind and demonstrated that not only does euglycemia (ie HbA1c <6%) not reduce cardiovascular risk it also is associated with a trend towards increased mortality.,/wiki/PACIFIC,,
Among patients with necrotizing pancreatitis with infected necrosis what are the differences in outcomes between a minimally invasive step-up approach and primary open necrosectomy?,Secondary infection of pancreatic necrosis remains a leading cause of death in necrotizing pancreatitis and is treated with percutaneous drainage and/or surgical debridement. However the choice of initial procedure has remained controversial. The Minimally Invasive Step Up Approach versus Maximal Necrosectomy in Patients with Acute Necrotising Pancreatitis (PANTER) trial randomized 88 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and infected necrosis to either a minimally invasive step-up approach or primary open necrosectomy. The step-up approach utilized percutaneous or endoscopic transgastric drainage followed by video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement if necessary. It found a 43% reduction in the composite primary outcome major complications or death. Significant reductions were seen in the rate of long-term complications health care utilization and total cost. Minimally invasive approaches to necrotizing pancreatitis are now rapidly becoming the standard of care with open surgery being generally reserved for cases of simultaneous intraabdominal complications.,/wiki/PANTER,,
Among patients with HFrEF does treatment with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor reduce CV mortality or HF hospitalizations when compared to ACE inhibitor therapy?,ACE inhibitor therapy reduces mortality in patients with HFrEF and has been the standard of care in this disease since the 1990s following publications of trials like CONSENSUS (1987) and SOLVD (1991) though ARBs may be substituted if ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated.[1] While beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists have further improved survival mortality remains high.,/wiki/PARADIGM-HF,,
In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) who have NYHA II-IV symptoms EF ≥45% elevated natriuretic peptide levels and evidence of structural heart disease does the ARNI sacubitril-valsartan lead to reduced rates of total hospitalisations for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes when compared to valsartan alone?,While several established treatments have been shown to improve outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) such as beta-blockers ACE-inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists[1][2][3] there is a lack of evidenced-based treatment shown to be beneficial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). More recently the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril-valsartan has been found to improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF. The 2014 PARADIGM-HF trial found that HFrEF patients (LVEF ≤40%) treated with sacubitril-valsartan had reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality heart failure hospitalizations and all-cause mortality compared to those treated with enalapril. The 2018 PIONEER-HF study[4] demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan reduced NT-proBNP levels in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure without increased rates of adverse events when compared to enalapril. Taken together these two trials suggest that HFrEF patients benefit from therapy with an ARNI.,/wiki/PARAGON-HF,,
Among patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who have received induction cisplatin/pemetrexed does maintenance pemetrexed improve PFS and OS compared to placebo?,"First-line therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC typically includes systemic chemotherapy with a platinum-based doublet and cisplatin-pemetrexed is a standard regimen for those with nonsquamous histology. Following 4-6 cycles of first-line therapy nonprogressors may proceed to maintenance therapy with one of the agents given as first-line therapy (so-called ""continuation maintenance"") or with a second-line agent (""switch maintenance""). Prior to PARAMOUNT SATURN and JMEN (2009)[1] demonstrated both PFS and/or OS benefits to switch maintenance therapy.

In patients with symptomatic severe AS who are intermediate-risk surgical candidates (expected periprocedural mortality ~ 4-8%) is transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) noninferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with regard to all-cause mortality and disabling stroke?,It is well-established that aortic valve replacement (AVR) prolongs survival in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).[1] However the condition often presents at an advanced age when patients are poor surgical candidates due to multiple comorbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) an emerging technology in which a self-expanding aortic valve prosthesis is inserted using a transcatheter approach is a less invasive alternative to open surgical AVR that has been shown to be an effective option both in patients who are at prohibitive surgical risk (20% absolute reduction in mortality vs. medical management; PARTNER B) and in patients who are high surgical risk (similar mortality to surgical AVR; PARTNER A). Whether these encouraging results with TAVI could be extended to the large population of AS patients at intermediate-risk for surgical complications was unknown. ,/wiki/PARTNER_2,,
In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are low risk surgical candidates (expected periprocedural mortality <4% mean 1.9%) is transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) non-inferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with respect to the primary composite outcome of death stroke or rehospitalization at 1 year?,The PARTNER series of randomized controlled trials has firmly established the role of TAVR with the balloon-expandable Edwards Sapien valve in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) at prohibitive risk of surgery (PARTNER A) high risk for surgery (PARTNER B) and intermediate risk for surgery (PARTNER 2). Analogous results have been demonstrated with the CoreValve and Evolut families of self-expandable TAVR valves. On the strength of these prior studies the 2017 ACC Expert Consensus Statement recommends a multidisciplinary Heart Team assessment to determine the relative benefit of proceeding with TAVR versus SAVR in individuals with at least intermediate risk for perioperative mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] score ≥4%) with SAVR [1]. Whether TAVR is an effective alternative to SAVR in patients at low surgical risk (STS score <4%) remained unknown.,/wiki/PARTNER_3,,
In patients with symptomatic severe AS who are high-risk surgical candidates (expected periprocedural mortality ~ 15%) is transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) noninferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with regard to all-cause mortality?,It is well-accepted that aortic valve replacement prolongs survival in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).[1] However the condition often presents at an advanced age when patients are poor surgical candidates due to multiple comorbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an emerging technology whereby a self-expanding aortic valve prosthesis is inserted using a transcatheter approach. The PARTNER B trial established the role of TAVI in patients with severe AS who are not surgical candidates due to cormorbidity as TAVI led to an absolute 20% reduction in all-cause mortality at 1 year with TAVI versus medical therapy. Given its inherently less invasive design the benefit of TAVI may extend to patients who remain surgical candidates but are nevertheless at high risk for periprocedural complications.,/wiki/PARTNER_A,,
In patients with severe AS who are poor surgical candidates does transcatheter aortic-valve implantation reduce all-cause mortality and rehospitalization rates when compared to standard care?,Surgical valve replacement reduces mortality in patients with symptomatic AS.[1] However the condition often presents at an advanced age when patients are poor surgical candidates from comorbidities. Balloon valvuloplasty is a temporizing measure that may improve symptoms in the short-term though is associated with increased stroke and other complications. Transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) is a procedure thought to be a reasonable alternative to surgical valve replacements as the implantation procedure is much less invasive. No large randomized trial had demonstrated its efficacy or safety in patients with AS thought to be poor surgical candidates.,/wiki/PARTNER_B,,
In patients with resistant hypertension treated with an ACEI/ARB CCB and a diuretic is the addition of spironolactone superior to placebo doxazosin or bisoprolol to control blood pressure?,Four smaller randomized placebo-controlled trials had previously found conflicting results about the benefit of adding spironolactone for reducing blood pressure for resistant hypertension.[1][2][3][4] PATHWAY-2 was a large multicenter double-blind study randomly assigning patients with resistant hypertension to sequential therapy with spironolactone doxazosin bisoprolol or placebo after a 1-month single-blind placebo run-in. Each therapy was given for 12 weeks initiated at a low dose and then doubled after week 6. An intention-to-treat analysis found that the average reduction in home systolic blood pressure was greater (P<0.0001) with spironolactone compared with placebo (-8.70 mm Hg) doxazosin (-4.03 mm Hg) and bisoprolol (-4.48 mm Hg). The authors also observed a differential benefit for spironolactone for SBP reduction by renin level. Specifically the reduction in SBP was greatest in the subgroup with low renin who were also randomized to spironolactone. The authors hypothesized that low renin may represent high volume status i.e. sodium retention. Spironolactone was the only study medication that was a diuretic and its benefit might be related to its volume reduction. Discontinuation due to renal impairment or hyperkalemia was uncommon. The authors concluded that among patients with hypertension resistant to combination therapy with ACEI/ARB CCB and a diuretic spironolactone was more effective at blood pressure lowering compared to doxazosin and bisoprolol.,/wiki/PATHWAY-2,,
In patients with atrial fibrillation on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) what proportion of patients experience a major bleed or arterial embolism when following a non-randomized structured holding pattern?,'Anticoagulation reduces stroke events in AF but its use is a risk factor for surgical bleeding. DOACs like apixaban rivaroxaban and dabigatran are generally simpler for chronic use in AF than warfarin since they don''t require INR monitoring or dietary pattern adherence. In the pre-DOAC era patients would hold their warfarin for a few days and an INR would be measured prior to surgery to confirm that the anticoagulant effects of this agent had worn off. Traditional coagulation assays (eg INR) do not correspond with the degree of ''blood thinning'' from DOACs and hospital laboratories cannot quickly measure DOAC serum levels on the day of a surgery. For adults with AF there was little guidance on perioperative holding DOAC holding strategies. ',/wiki/PAUSE,,
Does daily finasteride therapy reduce prostate cancer development when compared to placebo?,Androgens promote the development of prostate cancer. Inhibiting the synthesis of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with the 5α reductase inhibitor finasteride may therefore reduce the risk of prostate cancer. A large randomized clinical trial had not been undertaken however.,/wiki/PCPT,,
In patients who had an MI in the prior 1-3 years does ticagrelor+ASA reduce the risk of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction or stroke as compared to placebo?,Ticagrelor is a reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist which has been reported to be more effective and more rapid in inhibiting platelet aggregation as compared to clopidogrel.[1],/wiki/PEGASUS-TIMI_54,,
Among patients with submassive PE being treated with unfractionated heparin does administration of tenecteplase reduce all-cause mortality or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days when compared to placebo?,Thrombolysis with intravenous tPA is a standard treatment for acute massive PE.[1] However among patients with submassive PE namely those who are hemodynamically stable but have signs of RV dysfunction the selection of patients who may benefit from thrombolysis remains elusive. tPA has rarely been used in the latter population where the benefit of thrombolysis has not clearly been demonstrated to outweigh the risk of major bleeding. The MAPPET-3 trial[2] (2002) compared heparin therapy with either tPA or placebo in patients with submassive PE and found that tPA reduced a composite endpoint of in-hospital all-cause mortality or clinical decompensation requiring further intervention. However no survival benefit was seen an observation attributed in part to the excess in bleeding risk associated with tPA. A low-dose tPA regimen was studied in the 2013 MOPETT trial[3] which found reduction in pulmonary hypertension rates. However the trial was limited by its open-label single-center design low rate of patients meeting the traditional definition of submassive PE and questionable data collection practices.,/wiki/PEITHO,,
In patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis does pentoxifylline improve mortality? ,The 1992 study by Ramond et al Prednisolone in Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis demonstrated a mortality reduction when prednisolone was used to treat patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis though mortality in the treatment group was still 12% at 60 days. The high mortality in this disease may be related to elevations in TNF and the subsequent severe inflammatory response. Pentoxifylline decreases TNF and may therefore play a role in improving outcomes in acute alcoholic hepatitis. ,/wiki/Pentoxifylline_in_Severe_Alcoholic_Hepatitis,,
In low-risk outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) can the application of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) predict venous thromboembolism (VTE) and all-cause mortality rates at 45 days of less than 2%?,Excessive investigation for pulmonary embolism (PE) in low-risk patients has resulted in increased radiation exposure from CT angiography. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) study was a large prospective multicenter validation study evaluating the whether a low clinical suspicion and reassuring PERC score[1] could predict a low rate of VTE or all-cause mortality at 45 days among patients who did not undergo CT angiography. In patients presenting with symptoms concerning for PE PE or death within 45 days of enrollment occurred in only 1% of patients deemed low risk by clinical gestalt and a negative PERC score. This was beneath the 2% threshold chosen by the investigators — this was selected as the point of equipoise the point at which the risk/benefit of investigating for PE is balanced with the risk/benefit of not investigating.,/wiki/PERC,,
In patients admitted for first episode of syncope what is the prevalence of pulmonary embolism?,Syncope or a transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset short duration and spontaneous resolution due to transient cerebral hypoperfusion is a common cause for admission to the hospital. Although pulmonary embolism (PE) is commonly invoked as a potential cause of syncope its actual prevalence among patients admitted to the hospital for syncope is unknown. Furthermore it is unclear whether patients presenting with syncope due to PE can present without the classic signs and symptoms of PE such as hypoxia and tachycardia. A rigorous study designed to characterize the incidence of PE among patients presenting with syncope was needed in order to determine the appropriate index of suspicion for PE in these patients.,/wiki/PESIT,,
Among patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing PCI with stent placement does low-dose rivaroxaban plus either single or dual antiplatelet therapy reduce risk of bleeding when compared to warfarin plus dual antiplatelet therapy?,Up to 1 in 10 patients undergoing PCI have AF. Prior to the publication of WOEST (2013) and ISAR-TRIPLE (2015) clinical practice guidelines suggested that this particular patient population should be placed on a triple therapy anticoagulation strategy post-PCI with warfarin and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). However since WOEST and ISAR-TRIPLE current AHA/ACC guidelines suggest that in patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing PCI it is reasonable to maintain patients on oral anticoagulation (typically warfarin) and clopidogrel without ASA.[1] Based on data from RE-LY (2009) ARISTOTLE (2011) and ROCKET AF (2011) there is accumulating evidence supporting the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with AF compared to warfarin. However prior to the publication of PIONEER AF-PCI there were no clinical trials to support the use of DOACs in patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing PCI with stent placement. ,/wiki/PIONEER_AF-PCI,,
In patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction does initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy reduce NT-proBNP levels when compared to enalapril?,Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the backbone of HFrEF management. Earliest evidence for ACE inhibitors includes the CONSENSUS (1987) and SOLVD (1991) trials. ARBs are thought to have a similar effect as shown in CHARM-Alternative (2003). More recently ARB-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) may provide benefit over ACE-inhibitor as sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a 20% reduction in CVD mortality or HF hospitalization when compared to enalapril in PARADIGM-HF (2014). Patients with ADHF were excluded from PARADIGM-HF. Further the safety of ARNIs are safe for initiation during hospitalization for an acute decompensation. Current treatments for acute decompensated heart failure mainly consist of IV diuretics for volume overload.,/wiki/PIONEER-HF,,
In patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism what is the diagnostic accuracy of CT angiography for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism?,'PIOPED II (2006) is the largest study to date which compared CT angiography (CTA) against a composite reference standard and demonstrated an 83% sensitivity and 96% specificity in detecting an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition PIOPED II suggested that the predictive value of CTA is highly concordant with the pretest clinical probability of PE using Well''s criteria. ',/wiki/PIOPED_II,,
In hospitalized elderly patients treated with antibiotics does a microbial preparation containing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria prevent Clostridium difficile- or antibiotic-associated diarrhea?,The frequency of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) depends on the type of antibiotic ranging from 2-20% with cephalosporins fluoroquinolones macrolides or tetracycline 5-10% with ampicillin and 10-25% with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) a potentially severe infection accounts for 15-39% of AAD. AAD is thought to occur as a result of disruption of gut microbiota subsequent changes in metabolism of carbohydrates short-chain fatty acids and bile acids and impaired resistance to pathogens. Probiotics are speculated to prevent pathogenic bacterial infection through introduction of non-pathogenic bacteria. This may also assist in restoring the normal gut microbiome and prevent changes in metabolism and adherence of pathogens.,/wiki/PLACIDE,,
In patients with acute coronary syndrome does ticagrelor have an advantage over clopidogrel preventing major CV events?,The thienopyridines clopidogrel (CURE; 2001) and prasugrel (TRITON-TIMI 38; 2007) irreversibly inhibit platelets through P2Y12 ADP receptor blockade and reduce CV outcomes in ACS. The irreversible effects of both thienopyridines is thought to account for the increased bleeding from major surgical procedures including CABG[1] and thus investigators sought an antiplatelet agent with different pharmacokinetics. Ticagrelor is a nucleoside analogue acts via reversible inhibition of ADP receptors. It has a more rapid onset more potent platelet inhibition and more predictable pharmacodynamics[1] although its clinical utility had not yet been established.,/wiki/PLATO,,
In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) what is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in reducing mortality and microbiology recurrence?,Few studies had addressed the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in VAP and consequently many providers routinely recommended prolonged 14- or 21-day antibiotic courses for such patients. However heightened awareness of the association between prolonged antibiotics and multidrug-resistant infections raised concerns that perhaps this practice should be reconsidered. The PneumA trial compared two antibiotic durations for VAP and demonstrated similar 28-day mortality among patients treated with 8 days compared to 15 days. A subgroup analysis suggested that a 15-day course may be superior in cases of VAP due to lactose nonfermenting GNR (eg Pseudomonas aeruginosa).,/wiki/PneumA,,
Among patients with left sided infective endocarditis from a strep species E. faecalis S. aureus or coag-neg staph is switching to oral antibiotics to complete therapy after at least 10 days IV safe and as effective as continued IV antibiotics?,Infective endocarditis (IE) is typically medically treated with prolonged bactericidal IV antibiotics.[1] Prolonged IV therapy is expensive and requires complex outpatient care coordination or extended hospitalizations.[2] Transitioning to PO antibiotics after initial stabilization with IV antibiotics would simplify management but this approach had not been evaluated in a large clinical trial. ,/wiki/POET,,
Among patients with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke does the early administration of aspirin/clopidogrel reduce rates of subsequent strokes when compared to aspirin monotherapy?,Aspirin and other antiplatelet agents are the mainstays of therapy in patients with non-thromboembolic ischemic stroke and TIA and there has been interest in combining antiplatelet agents to improve efficacy. Prior studies in which patients received long-term treatment with aspirin/clopidogrel in CHARISMA MATCH and SPS3 suggested that dual antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk without significantly reducing the risk of stroke. However since the risk of stroke recurrence after TIA or minor stroke is front-loaded there continued to be interest in investigating the efficacy of a short course of dual antiplatelet therapy immediately following stroke or high-risk TIA. CHANCE demonstrated in a Chinese population that the combination of aspirin/clopidogrel for 21 days followed by clopidogrel monotherapy was superior to single-agent aspirin for reducing stroke recurrence at 90 days without a difference in bleeding rate between the two groups. Despite these promising results many European and North American clinicians were reluctant to apply this data to their patients for a variety of reasons. Chinese patients have a larger proportion of undertreated modifiable stroke risk factors (including diabetes and hypertension) a greater burden of intracranial large vessel atherosclerosis who are known to benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy (based on SAMMPRIS) and frequently have polymorphisms in genes regulating clopidogrel metabolism which are less common in Western populations. A randomized study of a broader population was necessary.,/wiki/POINT,,
In patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery does the use of perioperative beta-blockers reduce the risk of CV events or death?,Studies investigating the role of perioperative beta-blockade have yielded conflicting results. Some trials have shown a reduction in perioperative MI while others have demonstrated an increased risk of cardiogenic shock and death. Much of the evidence supporting the use of perioperative beta blockers came from the DECREASE trials which were discredited in 2011 for lack of appropriate consent inappropriate collection of data and data fabrication.[1] Before they were discredited DECREASE-I (1999) and DECREASE-IV (2009) supported the initiation of bisoprolol 7-21 days before surgery. No large trial had evaluated the use of beta blockers on the day of surgery. ,/wiki/POISE,,
Among patients with elevated operative risk does perioperative aspirin administration reduce all-cause mortality or non-fatal MI when compared to placebo?,Daily ASA is effective for primary and secondary prevention of MI in non-surgical patients.[1] However the use of this antiplatelet medication in surgical patients is controversial given its associated bleeding risk. The PEP trial (published in 2000)[2] demonstrated an increased rate of bleeding when aspirin was used in patients undergoing repair of a hip fracture. The medication demonstrated a decreased risk of VTE. Curiously this trial also showed a small but detectable increased risk of MIs with ASA use. Given these findings the role of perioperative ASA use was unclear.,/wiki/POISE-2_ASA,,
Among intubated patients does routine administration of pantoprazole reduce the risk of stress ulcer-associated bleeding or increase the risk of infections such as C. difficile-associated diarrhea or ventilator-associated pneumonia?,Classical teaching holds that critical illness is associated with gut dysmotility and inability to tolerate enteral feeding as well as stress ulcers. Historically these issues have been addressed by routinely delaying enteral nutrition and by routinely using prophylactic acid suppression in critically ill patients. However these classical teachings were reconsidered when several studies subsequently demonstrated that early feeding yields several benefits[1] and that routine stress ulcer prophylaxis may be associated with infectious complications including C. difficile-associated diarrhea and pneumonia.,/wiki/POP-UP,,
In patients with an indication for implantable defibrillator (ICD) are subcutaneous ICDs non-inferior to traditional transvenous ICDs with respect to device-related complications and inappropriate shocks?,Implantable defibrillators (ICDs) are effective in the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias. ICDs are generally indicated for individuals with a history of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (see AVID) as well as selected individuals without a history of arrhythmias but at elevated risk due to underlying heart disease most commonly significant systolic heart failure (see SCD-HEFT and MADIT-II).,/wiki/PRAETORIAN,,
Among patients with STEMI undergoing PCI does preventative PCI to non-infarct arteries with ≥50% stenosis reduce CV mortality non-fatal MI or refractory angina when compared to no preventative PCI?,The 2007 COURAGE trial demonstrated that preventative PCI plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) did not differ from OMT alone in patients with stable CAD for all-cause mortality and non-fatal MI. As such current guidelines recommend OMT-focused therapy for patients with CAD that would not clearly benefit from revascularization.[1]  In contrast patients presenting with STEMI clearly benefit from early PCI to the infarct artery.[2] However little is understood about subsequent treatment of non-infarct atheromas of substantial size.[3] 2013 ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend against PCI to non-infarct artery in patients with STEMI who are hemodynamically stable (class III level B).[4],/wiki/PRAMI,,
Among patients with arthritis requiring daily NSAID therapy and elevated CV risk is celecoxib noninferior to ibuprofen or naproxen with regard to cardiovascular death nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke? ,"NSAIDs are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. NSAIDs work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) which reduces pain and inflammation through inhibition of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins also play an important role in maintaining the gastric mucosa and promoting vasodilation. Inhibition of COX-2 is primarily responsible for pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects while inhibition of COX-1 leads to gastrointestinal toxic effects and may reduce vasodilation. Thus it is not entirely surprising that the selective COX-2 inhibitors (""coxibs"") have demonstrated similar efficacy in pain relief as nonselective COX inhibitors with less GI toxicity in previous trials.[1] However these trials also suggested possible increases in adverse cardiovascular outcomes with these drugs presumably by inhibition of protective vasodilating prostaglandins. These early trials only established the possibility of increased events with rofecoxib (now withdrawn from the market) and higher-than-recommended doses of celecoxib.[2][3] As a result a more contemporary trial using recommended doses of celecoxib was needed to establish cardiovascular safety of this drug compared to nonselective NSAIDs.",/wiki/PRECISION,,
In patients at high risk for CV disease does a Mediterranean diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduce MI CVA or CV death compared to a low-fat diet?,"'Epidemiologic trials from the 1960s suggested that a so-called ""Mediterranean diet"" rich in fresh fruits vegetables fish olive oil and wine was associated with decreased rates of CV disease.[1] Multiple studies have demonstrated a mortality benefit from a Mediterranean or Mediterranean-like diet after MI including DART (1989)[2] and the Cardioprotective Diet Study (1992).[3] Most recently the Lyon Diet Heart Study (1999)[4] demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet reduced recurrent CV events by 50-70% among MI patients.[5] The role of the Mediterranean diet in primary prevention of CV disease hadn''t been well established.'",/wiki/PREDIMED,,
In patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis does prednisolone improve survival?,Alcoholic hepatitis carries up to a 65% mortality rate and because therapy generally has consisted mainly of supportive measures many investigators have sought out disease-modifying interventions. In a sea of studies yielding conflicting results the present 1992 study was one of the first to suggest a survival benefit of glucocorticoids among patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.,/wiki/Prednisolone_in_Severe_Alcoholic_Hepatitis,,
In patients with acute proximal DVT does routine IVC filter placement in addition to anticoagulation reduce the short-term incidence of acute pulmonary embolism?,Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters sit within the inferior vena cava to mechanically prevent the translocation of thrombus from the lower extremity deep veins to the pulmonary vessels which would otherwise result in a pulmonary embolism (PE). The role of IVC filters in acute venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease is often unclear and rigorously debated. Given the well known efficacy of anticoagulation and the relative invasiveness of IVC filter placement early IVC filters were usually reserved for patients with contraindications to or failure of anticoagulant therapy. But in the late 1990s routine IVC filter placement became increasingly common in the wake of newer devices that could be placed percutaneously with relatively low complication rates.[1] Whether this increase in IVC filter placement yielded meaningful clinical benefits was unclear given the lack of randomized trial data. ,/wiki/PREPIC,,
In patients with acute pulmonary embolism and a high risk of recurrence does the addition of an IVC filter to anticoagulation alone reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism?,Despite therapeutic anticoagulation some patients with acute VTE experience recurrent events and IVC filters have been theorized to reduce recurrence. The initial PREPIC study (1998) demonstrated that among patients with acute proximal DVT permanent IVC filter placement reduced the rate of recurrent PE but markedly increased rates of DVT compared to anticoagulation alone and had no impact on overall survival.[1] Consequently standard practice is to offer IVC filters only to patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. PREPIC 2 sought to identify a subpopulation of patients with acute VTE in whom the risk of early recurrence was so great that perhaps temporary placement of a retrievable IVC filter may improve clinical outcomes compared to standard anticoagulation alone.,/wiki/PREPIC_2,,
In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation how does the safety and efficacy of the Watchman left atrial appendage closure device compare with long-term warfarin therapy for stroke prevention?,PROTECT AF showed that the Watchman LAA closure device was noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) but a periprocedural safety hazard was identified. The PREVAIL study was designed to provide additional information on the safety and efficacy of the LAA closure technology. PREVAIL randomized an additional 407 patients with nonvalvular AF in a 2:1 fashion to either LAA closure with the Watchman device or to a control arm which received antithrombotic therapy alone. The analysis was an intention-to-treat noninferiority analysis studying short- and long-term efficacy and safety outcomes. The first efficacy outcome a composite of stroke systemic embolism or cardiovascular/unexplained death did not meet the noninferiority criterion. Noninferiority was achieved with the other two outcomes namely the rate of late ischemic events (after 7 days of randomization) and the rate of early ischemic events and device/procedural complications (within 7 days of procedure). The authors conclude that LAA closure with the Watchman device may be appropriate for selected patients. Guidelines issued in 2019 recommend consideration of LAA closure for patients who are not candidates for long-term anticoagulation although PREVAIL did not study such a population. ,/wiki/PREVAIL,,
Among patients with latent TB is a more convenient regimen of 3 months of rifapentine plus isoniazid noninferior to the standard-of-care 9 months of isoniazid?,Isoniazid (INH) for 9 months under direct observation is a common treatment for latent TB. This regimen is 60-90% effective in reducing the rate of active TB but compliance is suboptimal owing to the long duration of therapy and to its adverse effects most notably hepatotoxicity. Many studies have thus evaluated alternative antibiotic regimens with shorter duration of therapy; these include 4 months of rifampin and 3 months of combined rifampin plus INH.,/wiki/PREVENT_TB,,
Among patients with early septic shock is early goal-directed therapy or a novel protocol-based therapy superior to usual care in reducing all-cause in-hospital mortality at 60 days?,A dramatic shift in the practice of critical care medicine followed the publication of the 2001 Rivers Trial a single urban-center trial demonstrating that an early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) protocol featuring aggressive resuscitation and early antibiotics led to an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 16% for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Resuscitation involved administration of fluids vasopressors and packed RBC transfusions guided by MAP CVP ScvO2 (which required central line placement) and UOP in the first 6 hours. The following year the international Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) was established to promote evidence-based approaches for reducing mortality from sepsis;[1] its guidelines reflect the EGDT protocol with a grade 1C recommendation.[2] Institutions implementing EGDT-like strategies have reported mortality reductions.[3],/wiki/ProCESS,,
Among fit patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma does FOLFIRINOX prolong overall survival compared to gemcitabine alone?,Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease especially for the 52% of patients who have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.[1]  For years patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were treated with gemcitabine monotherapy based on a trial published by Burris and colleagues that demonstrated a survival benefit of gemcitabine over bolus fluorouracil (5.65 vs. 4.41 months P=0.0025).[2] Many trials attempted to combine gemcitabine with another agent to further improve survival. Meta-analyses of trials with gemcitabine combinations in advanced pancreatic cancer failed to show significantly improved survival compared to gemcitabine alone.[3] [4] The combination of erlotinib and gemcitabine was shown to be statistically superior to gemctiabine alone and led to the FDA approval of erlotinib for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.[5] However this amounted to a survival benefit of only 0.33 months (6.24 vs. 5.91 months HR 0.82 95% CI 0.69-0.99 P=0.38) so this combination is not used in practice.[6]  More recently the 2013 Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT) evaluated the addition of nab-paclitaxel to gemcitabine. Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine did significantly improve overall survival over gemcitabine alone (8.5 vs. 6.7 months P<0.001) and this combination is a viable treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Among patients with a recent ischemic stroke how does combination aspirin-dipyridamole compare to clopidogrel in preventing recurrent stroke?,'Aspirin''s efficacy in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke was best demonstrated in the 2002 Antithrombotic Trialists'' Collaboration meta-analysis.[1] Randomized trials of other antiplatelet agents namely clopidogrel and combination aspirin-dipyridamole showed that perhaps greater benefits would be seen with alternative agents. For example CAPRIE demonstrated clopidogrel''s superiority over aspirin at reducing cardiovascular events and ESPS-2 and ESPRIT demonstrated that combination aspirin-dipyridamole outperformed aspirin in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. PRoFESS sought to determine whether these alternative antiplatelet therapies would perform similarly in reducing recurrent ischemic strokes. ',/wiki/PRoFESS,,
Among patients with unprovoked VTE does the end-of-treatment D-dimer level predict for future thrombosis and allow for tailored therapy?,Unprovoked VTE is associated with a high rate of recurrent VTE such that approximately one third of such patients will develop a recurrence within the 5 years after stopping anticoagulation. A number of studies have therefore evaluated the role of extended anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE including AMPLIFY-EXT and EINSTEIN CHOICE. But whether all patients with unprovoked VTE require indefinite anticoagulation is not known. Efforts are therefore underway to generate clinical and laboratory risk assessment tools for determining who is at the highest risk of recurrence and tailoring therapy accordingly. The D-dimer assay which directly measures the byproducts of thrombus formation is an attractive candidate marker the hypothesis being that patients with unprovoked VTE who have an elevated D-dimer after anticoagulation therapy may have a higher risk of recurrent VTE in the future. This had been demonstrated previously[1] but a prospective randomized trial was necessary.,/wiki/PROLONG,,
In patients with severe sepsis and septic shock does early goal-directed therapy reduce mortality compared to standard therapy in a multicenter trial?,'The Rivers Trial (2001) demonstrated a 16% absolute mortality reduction in severe sepsis and septic shock with the implementation of a specific goal-oriented resuscitation protocol which subsequently became known as early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). At its most basic EGDT dictates a series of CVP MAP and ScvO2 thresholds to target with the use of fluid boluses vasopressors and inotropes and transfusions. As a result of the survival benefit seen in the Rivers study EGDT quickly became implemented into the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines and thus became standard of care in the treatment of sepsis. Given the study''s limited sample size (N=263) and single-center design physicians and investigators called into question the reproducibility of the findings. Thus three concurrent randomized trials were undertaken to verify the results of the Rivers trial and confirm the benefits of EGDT in a broader patient population. Two of these trials ProCESS in the United States and ARISE in Australia failed to reproduce the findings of the Rivers Trial showing no benefit to EGDT over the standard of care. The major criticism of these trials was a lower-than-expected baseline mortality rate of ~20% at 60 to 90 days which limited power to detect a benefit of EGDT in these patients. Investigators called for additional randomized studies on the basis of these and other concerns.',/wiki/ProMISe,,
In critically ill ICU patients with suspected bacterial infections what is the benefit of a procalcitonin-guided strategy on mortality and antibiotic-free days?,Prolonged courses of antibiotics increase selective pressure in a population of bacteria to allow resistant bacteria to thrive and exposure of bacteria to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations increases the frequency of antibiotic resistant organisms.  As a result antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a public health issue of increasing magnitude and finding effective solutions to address this problem is a critical focus of the CDC.,/wiki/PRORATA,,
Among patients with severe ARDS does prone positioning reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days when compared to supine-only positioning?,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with a high mortality and prolonged periods of intubation. While some ground was gained through low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation (ARDSNet; 2000) low fluid volume (FACTT; 2006) and therapeutic paralysis (ACURASYS; 2010) the mortality approaches 25% even in the era of these and other lung-protective strategies.[1] Prone positioning which seems to improve ventilation-perfusion matching through aeration of previously atelectatic dependent alveoli has been shown in unblinded studies to improve survival particularly when used as rescue therapy in severe ARDS (ie P:F <100 mmHg). While this finding was corroborated in a 2010 meta-analysis of seven well-designed randomized trials in severe ARDS[2] a large randomized trial was lacking.,/wiki/PROSEVA,,
Among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation is percutaneous left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of vascular events?,It is estimated that only 50% of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who qualify for warfarin are actually treated.[1] This is a concern as the annual risk of stroke among those who are not anticoagulated range from 1.5% in individuals aged 50–59 years to 23.5% for those aged 80–89 years.[2] Alternatives to anticoagulation have thus been pursued. One strategy involves obliteration of the left atrial appendage (LAA) since this site is a common location of clot formation in non-valvular AF. ,/wiki/PROTECT_AF,,
Among patients with recent ACS does high-dose atorvastatin reduce the rate of CV events compared to moderate-dose pravastatin?,The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial published in 2004 randomized 4162 patients with recent ACS to high-dose atorvastatin 80mg daily or moderate-dose pravastatin 40mg daily. Using non-inferiority analysis at a mean follow-up of 2 years the high-dose atorvastatin group was associated with a reduction in the composite endpoint of death MI UA requiring hospitalization revascularization at ≥30 days or stroke (22.4% vs. 26.3%). Atorvastatin was associated with a significantly reduced LDL (62 vs. 95 mg/dL) and a nonsignificant reduction in mortality compared to pravastatin (2.2% vs. 3.2%). There were no differences in rates of drug discontinuation due to myalgias elevated CPK or rhabdomyolysis.,/wiki/PROVE_IT-TIMI_22,,
Among patients with severe sepsis does activated protein C improve survival?,The end-organ dysfunction that accompanies severe sepsis and septic shock is in part mediated by a systemic proinflammatory and procoagulant state leading to the hypothesis that recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa DrotAA) may improve survival when administered to adults with severe sepsis.,/wiki/PROWESS,,
Among patients with septic shock does activated protein C decrease mortality?,The end-organ dysfunction that accompanies severe sepsis and septic shock is in part mediated by a systemic proinflammatory and procoagulant state. Since activated protein C promotes fibrinolysis and inhibits thrombosis it was hypothesized that recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa DrotAA) may improve survival when administered to patients with severe sepsis. This was initially tested in the 2001 PROWESS trial which demonstrated a survival benefit among patients with severe sepsis randomized to DrotAA (28-day mortality of 24.7% vs. 30.8% with placebo). Subgroup analyses suggested the greatest benefit occurred in patients with a high risk of death (ie APACHE II scores ≥25).[1][2][3] As a result the FDA approved DrotAA for use only in patients with severe sepsis and a high risk of death and requested further studies to evaluate DrotAA among less critically ill patients.,/wiki/PROWESS-SHOCK,,
In non-critically ill inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were insulin-naive is a basal-bolus insulin regimen more effective and safer for glycemic control as compared to sliding-scale regular insulin?,Poor glycemic control is associated with worse outcomes in critical and non-critically ill patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).[1][2] At the time of the trial the optimal management strategy for glycemic control of hospitalized patients was unclear. Although sliding-scale insulin (SSI) was widely used there are significant disadvantages associated with this reactive strategy which attempts to treat rather than prevent hyperglycemia. Queale et al. reported that SSI is associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of hyperglycemia as compared to patients not receiving glycemic therapy.[3] In children admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis SSI was associated with a longer duration of ketoacidosis and length of stay.[4],/wiki/RABBIT_2,,
Among patients with permanent atrial fibrillation what is the effect of lenient compared to strict rate control strategies on cardiovascular events?,AFFIRM (2002) suggested a mortality benefit in management of AF with rate control over rhythm control. The 2010 Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation: a Comparison between Lenient versus Strict Rate Control II (RACE II) trial directly addressed the issue of optimal rate control for patients with permanent AF and found that a lenient rate control strategy (resting HR <110 bpm) was noninferior to a strict rate control strategy (resting HR <80 bpm and HR during moderate exercise <110 bpm) in preventing the composite outcome of CV death CHF hospitalization stroke systemic embolism bleeding and life threatening arrhythmic events over 3 years.  ,/wiki/RACE_II,,
In patients with non-traumatic low pain back does rapid MRI compared with conventional radiography for diagnosis decrease back pain-related disability patient perception of pain or health care costs?,Low back pain is a common office complaint in both primary care physician clinics. In one study approximately 8% of American adults reported at least 1 episode of severe acute low back pain within a one year period.[1] The prognosis is generally good with a majority of patients improving with conservative management. Pain and disability often rapidly improves within the first month with a return to work rate of 82% for those initially off work and further improvements up to three months.[2] Clinicians are therefore faced with the decision to image or to empirically provide supportive care with analgesics and physical therapy. In those undergoing imaging plain film radiographs have frequently been employed but the diagnostic yield is low in patients with acute non-traumatic low back pain. With advancements in MRI technology rapid MRIs for lumbar spine have made it a potentially viable option as the initial imaging modality in patients with lower back pain. The excellent soft tissue resolution allows for better identifications of structural abnormalities which may or may not be symptomatic. While MRI may improve upon the diagnostic yield compared to plain film radiograph further study would be required to demonstrate whether MRI would meaningfully improve patient outcomes prompting this randomized trial.,/wiki/Radiograph_vs._MRI_for_low_back_pain,,
Among patients with heart failure (NYHA class II or III) widened QRS and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30% does the addition of CRT to an ICD reduce the mortality and morbidity as compared to ICD alone?,The benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for patients with heart failure has been observed in many trials including the CARE-HF MIRACLE MADIT-CRT and REVERSE trials.[1][2][3][4] The CARE-HF showed that in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony CRT significantly reduced mortality and hospitalization for a major CV event as compared to medical treatment only. In the MADIT-CRT trial CRT combined with ICD (CRT-ICD) reduced the rate of all-cause mortality or non-fatal heart failure in patients with NYHA class II heart failure LVEF ≤30% and QRS duration ≥130 msec.,/wiki/RAFT,,
In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class III-IV symptoms does spironolactone reduce mortality?,'RALES was the first of a series of trials to prospectively study aldosterone antagonists'' mortality benefits in HFrEF. Patients with NYHA class III-IV ischemic or nonischemic HF and EF <35% were randomized to spironolactone or placebo with a majority of patients receiving a background of loop diuretics ACE inhibitors and digoxin. RALES demonstrated a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality with spironolactone without a significant increase in the risk of serious hyperkalemia or renal failure as had been hypothesized.',/wiki/RALES,,
For prehospitalized patients in status epilepticus how effective is intramuscular midazolam compared with intravenous lorazepam for seizure termination?,The current definition of status epilepticus is more than 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity or recurrent seizure activity within this period. This definition is based on the knowledge that seizures extending past 5 minutes are much less likely to spontaneously terminate and animal studies suggested that permanent neuronal injury and resistance to treatment may set in between 5-30 minutes.[1][2][3] Rapid termination of seizure activity is therefore paramount and with multiple antiepileptic agents available randomized studies were needed to determine the most efficacious approach. The Veterans Affairs Status Epilepticus Cooperative Study Group showed better seizure control with lorazepam compared to phenytoin as an initial agent in the context of overt generalized convulsive status epilepticus. The subsequent PHTSE trial[4] comparing diazepam lorazepam and placebo failed to find a significant difference between the two benzodiazepines although there was a trend toward better termination with lorazepam. When intramuscular (IM) formulations of midazolam became readily available these gained significant popularity with paramedics due to their convenience and ease of use.  Also unlike lorazepam midazolam has favorable stability and shelf-life parameters when not refrigerated. A randomized study comparing midazolam and lorazepam was needed to demonstrate comparative efficacy between the two approaches.,/wiki/RAMPART,,
In patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis how does rituximab compare to cyclophosphamide for induction of remission when combined with glucocorticoids?,The ANCA-associated vasculitides (eg granulomatosis with polyangiitis or GPA and microscopic polyangiitis or MPA) affect small- and medium-caliber vessels and are associated with pulmonary and renal injury. The efficacy of cyclophosphamide in combination with glucocorticoids was first demonstrated by Fauci and colleagues in the late 1970s and early 1980s[1][2] and has been the mainstay of therapy since. The role of the newer anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab was unclear.,/wiki/RAVE,,
In patients with mechanical heart valves what dose of dabigatran best achieves therapeutic trough levels and how do these doses compare to warfarin in terms of efficacy and safety?,Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor with several benefits compared to warfarin and growing evidence supports its use in various thrombotic conditions. For example among patients with atrial fibrillation RE-LY (2009) demonstrated the superior efficacy of dabigatran for stroke prevention without increasing rates of bleeding compared to warfarin. For patients with acute VTE RE-COVER (2009) demonstrated similar efficacy and safety with dabigatran compared to warfarin. However among patients with mechanical heart valves no large randomized trial had compared dabigatran to the standard of care warfarin.,/wiki/RE-ALIGN,,
Among patients with acute VTE how does dabigatran compare to warfarin with respect to VTE recurrence and bleeding risk?,The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has long been the standard of care for outpatient therapy of VTE. However its use requires frequent lab draws for monitoring and dose adjustment and as a result a therapeutic INR is achieved only about 60% of the time. Alternative therapies to warfarin include dabigatran an oral direct thrombin inhibitor and rivaroxaban an oral factor Xa inhibitor both of which theoretically require no monitoring. The RE-COVER trial is part of an industry-supported series of trials investigating the role of dabigatran as an alternative to warfarin therapy. It was published in 2009 the same year as the RE-LY trial which demonstrated the noninferiority of dabigatran to warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.,/wiki/RE-COVER,,
In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery disease is dual therapy with a thienopyridine antiplatelet and dabigatran associated with less bleeding when compared to triple therapy with aspirin a thienopyridine antiplatelet and dabigatran? Is dual therapy associated a higher rate of thrombosis?,"Anti-thrombotic management of patients with nonvalvular AF undergoing PCI represents a clinical challenge as therapeutic anticoagulation is known to prevent ischemic stroke while dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a thienopyridine (e.g. clopidogrel ticagrelor) is generally considered standard of care to prevent stent thrombosis in the post-PCI period. At the same time so called ""triple therapy"" with aspirin a thienopyridine and an oral anticoagulant has been shown to result in high rates of clinical bleeding.[1] In an effort to refine the balance of antithrombotic protection and risk of bleeding there has been significant interest in assessing the safety and efficacy of several intermediate anti-thrombotic regimens in this population.",/wiki/RE-DUAL,,
Among individuals with chronic atrial fibrillation how does dabigatran compare to warfarin in terms of stroke risk and the risk of major bleeding?,'Prior to RE-LY warfarin was the primary anticoagulant used in the prevention of thromboembolic stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin''s advantages included its inexpensive cost and once daily dosing. Warfarin is less than ideal however because of the variable amount of vitamin K in food its steep dose-response relationship interactions with other drugs and the fact that only 60% of patients are maintained within an INR of 2.0 to 3.0. Dabigatran is a new direct thrombin inhibitor marketed under the name Pradaxa. It use in prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation was not known.',/wiki/RE-LY,,
Among patients receiving dabigatran who develop serious bleeding or need an urgent invasive procedure does idarucizumab reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran?,Dabigatran is an orally administered direct thrombin inhibitor approved by the FDA for use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation DVT/PE and for VTE prophylaxis after hip surgery based in part upon data from RE-LY and RE-COVER studies. One major factor for both clinicians and patients when choosing between warfarin and newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has been the lack of a suitable reversal agent for the management of serious bleeding or urgent invasive procedures. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity and has been in development as a reversal agent for patients receiving dabigatran anticoagulation.  ,/wiki/RE-VERSE_AD,,
In patients with acute myocardial infarction is a restrictive transfusion threshold (hemoglobin ≤8 g/dL) non inferior for 30-day MACE events when compared to liberal transfusion threshold (hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL)?,Based upon results of trials like TRICC (1999) TRISS (2014) hgb transfusion thresholds among adult patients has lowered to the ~7-8 g/dL. Observational studies have identified anemia as a risk factor for mortality among those with MI but the role for transfusion in this population is unclear.[1] It is possible that adults with MI might have reduced coronary perfusion which might worsen MI outcomes for example. However the 2015 TITRe2 trial[2] found no benefit for higher transfusion thresholds among adults undergoing cardiac surgery (about half of whom underwent CABG). Whether a restrictive transfusion threshold was non-inferior to a liberal transfusion threshold among adults with MI was unclear. ,/wiki/REALITY,,
In patients hospitalized with Covid-19 does the addition of dexamethasone improve survival compared to usual care?,In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic clinicians and investigators scrambled to develop effective therapies for patients particularly those with severe disease in whom the case fatality rate was very high. Authors of mechanistic studies case reports retrospective studies and clinical guidelines advocated for remdesivir hydroxychloroquine antiretrovirals anticoagulants and other therapies on the basis of limited data which at best was hypothesis-generating. As randomized data became available it became clear that many of these treatments were modestly effective if at all: remdesivir improved time to recovery but did not impact survival[1][2] hydroxychloroquine did not improve clinical outcomes when given as Covid-19 therapy[3] or as postexposure prophylaxis[4] and the antivirals lopinavir-ritonavir were ineffective.[5] Steroids had been proposed as well but a well designed randomized study was needed to demonstrate their efficacy in Covid-19. ,/wiki/RECOVERY_(Covid-19),,
Among patients with LV systolic dysfunction and mild-to-moderate anemia does the use of darbepoetin targeting a hemoglobin >13 g/dL reduce the composite outcome of all-cause mortality or first hospitalization for HF? ,Anemia affects some 25-40% of patients with HF and is associated with reduced survival and poor quality of life.[1] In patients with an unidentified cause of anemia retrospective data suggested that erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) could improve hemoglobin and quality of life while reducing hospitalization rates. Small non-blinded prospective studies suggested a similar improvement with ESAs. Two larger trials including STAMINA-HeFT[2](2008) randomized patients to darbepoetin alfa or placebo and demonstrated a favorable trend in the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or first HF hospitalization. This prompted the larger phase III RED-HF study.[1],/wiki/RED-HF,,
In patients with an acute COPD exacerbation is 5 days of glucocorticoid treatment non-inferior to 14 days of glucocorticoid treatment in preventing repeat exacerbations?,The efficacy of systemic glucocorticoids in treatment of acute COPD exacerbations was demonstrated by the SCCOPE trial[1] and a trial by Davies et al.[2] both published in 1999. Parenteral and enteric admistration of equivalent doses of glucocorticoids were demonstrated as equivalent by de Jong and colleagues in 2007.[3] While no large randomized trial has evaluated appropriate dosing of glucocorticoids a 2010 prospective cohort study by Lindenauer et al.[4] demonstrated that low dose enteral therapy had no difference in treatment failures when compared to high dose parenteral therapy in non-ICU patients. Likewise no large randomized trial had demonstrated that a longer course was more efficacious than a short course though a 2011 Cochrane review suggested that there were no differences in treatment failures.[5],/wiki/REDUCE,,
In patients with established atherosclerotic heart disease or diabetes with an additional risk factor on pre-existing statin therapy with residual hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglyceride level 135-499 mg/dL) does icosapent ethyl a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester reduce cardiovascular events compared to placebo?,Multiple epidemiologic studies have established elevated triglyceride (TG) levels as an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.[1][2] However in randomized trials medications that reduce TG levels such as niacin fibrates and n-3 fatty acid products have not reduced cardiovascular events when added to appropriate medical therapy including statins.[3][4] More recently however the JELIS trial demonstrated a 19% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events when 1.8g daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was added to low-intensity statin therapy [5] Although promising the JELIS trial was limited by an open-label design lack of placebo control and geographic limitation to patients in Japan.,/wiki/REDUCE-IT,,
In patients with symptomatic heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF LVEF ≥ 50% NYHA II-IV) does the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil improve exercise capacity or clinical status compared to placebo?,Despite a large number of randomized controlled studies investigating the effects of neurohormonal blockade beta blockade vasodilation and modulation of other common targets of cardiac therapeutics (see CHARM-Preserved TOPCAT NEAT-HFpEF) there is no therapy clearly proven to improve mortality or clinical status in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). By inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to reverse adverse cardiac remodeling enhance vascular neuroendocrine and renal function and reduce pulmonary artery pressure thus potentially targeting several key derangements thought to underlie HFpEF. Furthermore PDE5 inhibition has previously been shown in a small study to improve hemodynamics left ventricular diastolic function left ventricular hypertrophy and lung function after 6-12 months in patients with HFpEF.[1] A larger randomized controlled trial was needed to establish whether PDE5 inhibition may improve exercise capacity and clinical status in patients with HFpEF.,/wiki/RELAX,,
In patients with end-stage heart failure does destination LVAD therapy reduce all-cause mortality as compared to optimal medical therapy?,Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) therapy was first developed as a short-term mechanical circulatory support for patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplant. The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) study aimed to determine the suitability of LVAD for destination therapy. ,/wiki/REMATCH,,
Among patients with diabetic nephropathy do ARBs reduce progression to end stage renal disease or death? ,Although the CSG Captopril Trial (1993) demonstrated the renoprotective efficacy of ACE inhibitors in patients with T1DM-associated nephropathy there is more evidence for the renoprotective efficacy of ARBs in patients with T2DM-associated nephropathy.  Two major trials IDNT (2001) and RENAAL compared ARBs to placebo and demonstrated that ARBs are effective in reducing proteinuria and slowing the progression to ESRD.  About 80% of the renoprotective benefits of ARB therapy have been attributed to its antihypertensive effects[1] with the remaining benefit likely related to inhibition of the proliferative effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.[2],/wiki/RENAAL,,
What is the role of decompressive craniectomy compared to barbiturate coma for patients with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and intracranial hypertension refractory to typical medical management?,The role of decompressive craniectomy in patients with post-traumatic intracranial hypertension that is refractory to medical management alone remains unclear. The 2011 DECRA study[1] suggested that no benefit was gained from decompressive bifrontal craniectomy however the trial was limited by its restrictive eligibility criteria. RESCUEicp was an international randomized trial of surgical decompression among a broader range of patients more typical of those encountered in routine practice.,/wiki/RESCUEicp,,
Among patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke does closure of a PFO reduce recurrent stroke when compared to medical therapy alone?,"The large CLOSURE I trial (2012) demonstrated that routine PFO closure does not reduce rates of recurrent CVA among patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke and PFO. However CLOSURE I was criticized because a large proportion of its patients had several CV risk factors (diabetes hypertension etc.) and their qualifying ""cryptogenic stroke"" may have in fact been a result of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. In addition CLOSURE I used the STARFlex device for PFO closure but extrapolation of data to other devices is difficult and the device manufacturer has since gone out of business. The PC Trial (2013)[1] and RESPECT which began enrollment concurrently with CLOSURE I in 2003 studied a similar patient population using the Amplatzer PFO Occluder closure device.",/wiki/RESPECT,,
Does the addition of rifaximin to lactulose improve reversal of hepatic encephalopathy among hospitalized patients?,Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major cause of morbidity for individuals with cirrhosis. Lactulose had been used as treatment for this condition long before it was demonstrated effective as secondary prevention in a 2009 trial by Sharma and colleagues.[1] This medication lowers pH in the colon which promotes development of insoluble ammonium over soluble ammonia. Furthermore its laxative effects increase removal of ammonia from the GI tract. Rifaximin is a minimally-absorbed antibiotic that reduces urease-producing bacteria in the GI tract which results in decreased ammonia production. Its efficacy in prevention of HE was shown in a 2010 publication by Bass and colleagues.[2] The role of rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose therapy in acute HE was unknown.,/wiki/Rifaximin_and_Lactulose_for_HE,,
Among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock what is the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in decreasing the risk of mortality?,The Rivers trial randomized 263 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock at a single urban Detroit ED to a protocol of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) vs. standard therapy. In the EGDT arm patients received an arterial line and a central line with continuous central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) monitoring. The EGDT group consisted of several sequential goals in the ER prior to ICU admission:,/wiki/Rivers_Trial,,
Among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is rivaroxaban noninferior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic thromboembolism?,Rivaroxaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor of great appeal because of its long half-life once-daily dosing and reliable anticoagulation obviating the need for laboratory monitoring. Several studies have evaluated the noninferiority of rivaroxaban compared to warfarin in various conditions and ROCKET AF is among those comparing the two in atrial fibrillation.,/wiki/ROCKET_AF,,
In patients with moderate to severe ARDS does the early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium improve mortality when used with current light sedation protocols?,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) has a mortality rate approaching 50%.[1] Numerous therapeutics have been trialed and failed in ARDS including prostaglandins statins pentoxifylline N-acetylcysteine ketoconazole dazoxiben acyclovir and indomethacin. Three positive trials in ARDS studied low-tidal ventilation (ARDSNet 2000) prone ventilation (PROSEVA 2013) and early neuromuscular (NM) blockade (ACURASYS 2010). ACURASYS was a multicenter RCT in 20 ICUs in France that enrolled 340 patients with ARDS. It compared early NM blockade with cisatracurium for 48 hours to usual care. Patients received deep sedation. NM blockade was associated with a 9% absolute risk reduction in 28-day mortality. Despite the mortality benefit in ACURASYS early NM blockade has not been widely adopted in clinical practice given concerns over ICU-acquired weakness ICU-acquired PTSD and post-ICU syndrome. Practice guidelines deemed the overall evidence for early NM blockade in ARDS to be weak.[2] Further ICU practices have shifted since the publication of ACURASYS and now focus on significantly lighter sedation goals.[3] Whether early NM blockade plays a role in modern ARDS management is unknown.,/wiki/ROSE,,
In premenopausal women who experience 3 urinary tract infections per year does increasing water intake to more than 1.5L per day decrease the number of recurrent urinary tract infections?,Acute uncomplicated cystitis can affect half of the female population over their lifetime. While self-limiting the vast majority will report pain discomfort and a decrease in quality of life. Commonly antimicrobials are prescribed to treat this infection and in the modern era of growing antimicrobial resistance finding interventions to limit their utilization and saving this precious resource for the future or my more serious infections. Prior to this trial the common teaching for women with recurrent UTI was to increase their water intake.,/wiki/S-HYDRACYST,,
In patients who had been recently hospitalized for ACS what is the safety and efficacy of sertraline treatment for recurrent depression? ,Most post-ACS patients who experience symptoms of depression are not administered antidepressants because 50% of episodes spontaneously remit and there is little evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of antidepressants in post-ACS patients. TCAs can treat depression but their use has been associated with orthostatic hypotension QT prolongation and arrhythmic deaths and thus their use in post-ACS depression is controversial. This study therefore sought to investigate the role of a different class of antidepressents namely SSRIs.,/wiki/SADHART,,
Among ICU patients does albumin compared to normal saline for fluid resuscitation improve clinical outcomes? ,The medical literature has few rigorous studies of optimal fluid choices for intravascular fluid resuscitation. The 2004 Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) trial randomized 6997 ICU patients requiring IV fluids to either albumin or saline. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between the two groups. A subgroup analysis demonstrated that albumin was associated with poorer outcomes when administered to patients with traumatic brain injury. There was a non-significant trend towards mortality benefit with albumin use in patients with severe sepsis. A 2013 Cochrane review[1] found no benefit of albumin over crystalloids for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients (all-cause mortality RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.93-1.10) leading the authors to conclude that the use of colloids is unjustified given their increased cost and lack of benefit.,/wiki/SAFE,,
Among noncritically ill adult patients in the ED does fluid management with balanced crystalloid result in earlier hospital discharge compared to isotonic crystalloids?,The supra-physiological chloride concentration of isotonic crystalloid (normal saline) has been hypothesized to offer inferior outcomes compared to nearer physiologic alternatives such as balanced crystalloids (Plasma-Lyte Lactated Ringer’s). Although preclinical models have speculated high chloride content contributing to acidosis renal injury and mortality observational and pilot studies have failed to detect clinically significant differences when comparing these two options.[1][2][3],/wiki/SALT-ED,,
In patients with recent TIA/CVA due to 70-99% intra-cranial artery stenosis does percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) in addition to aggressive medical therapy decrease recurrent stroke?,Atherosclerosis resulting in stenosis of the major intracranial (IC) arteries (carotid siphon MCA vertebral and basilar) is an important etiology of ischemic stroke.  In the US IC stenosis causes about 50000 ischemic strokes every year.  Patients with recent TIA/CVA and intra-cranial (IC) artery stenosis of 70 to 99% are at particularly high risk for recurrent strokes.  The WASID trial placed the 30-day rate of stroke or death at 10.7% and a 1-year rate at 25%. [1],/wiki/SAMMPRIS,,
What is the effect of captopril on mortality among patients with acute MI complicated by asymptomatic LV dysfunction?,The 1992 Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial demonstrated a 19% reduction in mortality with captopril compared to placebo among patients with acute MI complicated by asymptomatic LV dysfunction. This study echoed the results of the prior CONSENSUS (1987) and SOLVD (1991) studies of ACE inhibitors in chronic HF and is the basis of recommendations for the addition of ACE inhibitors in LV dysfunction complicating acute MI. The related GISSI-3 study (1994) demonstrated that ACE inhibitors have a mortality benefit following an MI regardless of subsequent LV function.,/wiki/SAVE,,
In patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) how does latanoprost compare to timolol in terms of treatment effect and side effects?,The main side effects observed are increased pigmentation of the iris induced by latanoprost and reduced heart rate by timolol.,/wiki/Scandinavian_Latanoprost_Study_Group,,
In patients with HFrEF and NYHA II-III symptoms how does amiodarone or ICD implantation compare to placebo in reducing all-cause mortality?,Prophylactic ICD placement in post-MI patients with LVEF ≤30% was shown to improve survival in MADIT-II (2002). The role of ICDs and the antiarrhythmic amiodarone was unclear in those with heart failure with reduced EF regardless of MI history.,/wiki/SCD-HeFT,,
In mechanically ventilated ICU patients what is the efficacy and safety of prolonged sedation with dexmedetomidine compared to midazolam?,'The Safety and Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine Compared with Midazolam (SEDCOM) trial was a multicenter trial that randomly assigned 375 mechanically ventilated ICU patients to receive dexmedetomidine or midazolam until extubation or for a maximum of 30 days.  Contrary to previous studies which suggested that dexmedetomidine attained the sedation target more frequently than benzodiazepines there was no difference in the trial''s primary endpoint time at the targeted sedation level.  The dexmedetomidine group had 30% less delirium and spent 1.9 fewer days on the ventilator.  Bradycardia was more common among dexmedetomidine-treated patients while hypertension and tachycardia were more common among midazolam-treated patients.  ',/wiki/SEDCOM,,
In patients with cancer-associated VTE how does rivaroxaban compare to dalteparin in terms of efficacy and safety?,Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was established as the standard of care for treating patients with cancer-associated VTE after CLOT (2003) demonstrated the superiority of dalteparin over warfarin in this patient group. Newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including dabigatran edoxabain rivaroxaban and apixaban have similar if not improved outcomes versus warfarin but the pivotal trials leading to their approval only included a small number of patients with cancer-associated VTE and thus LMWH has remained the standard of care. Meta-analyses provided encouraging evidence that DOACs were likely safe and efficacious in this population but randomized studies were needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of DOACs versus LMWH in patients with cancer-associated VTE.,/wiki/SELECT-D,,
For patients with septic shock does treatment to a goal MAP of 80-85 mmHg reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days when compared to a goal MAP of 65-70 mmHg?,No large randomized-controlled trial exist to support a MAP target in sepsis. A higher MAP goal than the current 65 mmHg as recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign[1] may theoretically improve end-organ perfusion especially for those with chronic hypertension.[2],/wiki/SEPSISPAM,,
In patients with symptomatic HFrEF (NYHA II-IV; LVEF ≤ 35%) with hospitalization for heart failure within the preceding year and resting heart rate of ≥ 70bpm despite maximal medical therapy including beta blockers does the addition of the sinus node inhibitor ivabradine result in improved heart failure-related mortality or hospitalization compared to placebo?,On the strength of large RCTs including MERIT-HF and COPERNICUS demonstrating clear mortality benefit beta blockers have become standard of care in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). A major mechanism by which these agents are thought to provide benefit is by reducing myocardial oxygen demand by lowering heart rate through antagonism of sympathetic receptors in myocardial pacemaking tissue. This mechanism is supported by studies demonstrating strong associations between increasing resting heart rate (HR) and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.[1],/wiki/SHIFT,,
Among patients who developed cardiogenic shock during acute MI what are the benefits of early revascularization compared to initial medical stabilization on mortality?,The role of primary PCI in cardiogenic shock was evaluated in the 1999 SHould we emergently revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic shocK (SHOCK) trial which randomized 302 patients in cardiogenic shock after acute MI to a strategy of early revascularization (PCI or CABG within 12 hours of diagnosis) or to initial medical stabilization including fibrinolysis and IABP.  There was a trend towards improved survival in the primary endpoint of mortality at 30 days but this failed to achieve significance.  This may be due to the fact that the trial was underpowered to detect such a difference.  However the benefit became significant at 6 months and follow-up of the SHOCK trial cohort demonstrated the benefit or revascularization at 1 and 6 years suggesting that the benefit of revascularization persisted for years.,/wiki/SHOCK,,
In asthmatics does the addition of the long-acting ß-agonist salmeterol to asthma therapy increase respiratory-related adverse events and mortality?,Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) such as salmeterol have since the 1990s been mainstays of therapy for persistent asthma. This trial was designed after observational studies suggested an increase in asthma-related mortality despite optimal medical therapy raising the question that perhaps some deaths were related to complications of therapy.,/wiki/SMART,,
Among medical and surgical ICU patients does the choice of fluid (normal saline versus a balanced crystalloid such as LR or Plasma-Lyte) impact rates of death need for renal-replacement therapy or persistent renal dysfunction?,'Normal saline has been associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal injury prompting the hypothesis that isotonic crystalloids may offer inferior outcomes compared with balanced crystalloids such as lactated Ringer''s solution (LR) and Plasma-Lyte. While preclinical models have suggested this hypothesis may be true small studies in humans have failed to detect clinically significant differences.[1][2][3]',/wiki/SMART-MED_and_SMART-SURG,,
Among patients with shock how does dopamine compare to norepinephrine in decreasing mortality?,Dopamine and norepinephrine had long been considered equivalent first-line agents for the treatment of shock but the first SOAP trial[1] suggested that dopamine was an independent predictor of increased mortality in shock. A related 2004 Cochrane meta-analysis[2] was limited in its ability to inform clinical practice as it only included 62 patients. ,/wiki/SOAP_II,,
In patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor superior to aspirin in preventing short-term recurrent stroke MI or death?,Ischemic stroke and TIA are common and risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events is very high in the acute post-stroke period. On the strength of multiple large randomized trials demonstrating benefit in reducing recurrent events consensus AHA/ASA guidelines recommend initiation of aspirin therapy in all patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke or TIA.[1] Even with aspirin therapy however the rate of recurrent stroke is still 15-20% within the first 90 days after an acute stroke or TIA. As a result it is believed that more intense antiplatelet therapy may provide additional benefit in terms of prevention of recurrent ischemic events. Along these lines the recent CHANCE trial demonstrated that in a large population of Chinese patients presenting with acute minor stroke or TIA upfront dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel provided a 3.5% absolute reduction in recurrent neurologic ischemic events at 90 days. ,/wiki/SOCRATES,,
Among patients with HFrEF does the addition of enalapril to conventional medical therapy reduce mortality or HF hospitalizations?,The earlier V-HeFT trial in 1986 demonstrated a trend towards reduced mortality when vasodilators were added to conventional therapy for HF and the subsequent CONSENSUS trial in 1987 demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mortality with the vasodilator and ACE inhibitor enalapril among patients NYHA class IV HFrEF.,/wiki/SOLVD,,
In patients with a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) does a strategy adding comprehensive CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis to limited occult cancer screening result in detection of more occult malignancies? ,Malignancy is a well-recognized risk factor for VTE.  Unprovoked VTE can be a presenting symptom of undiagnosed malignancy and historically up to 10% of patients with an unprovoked VTE event are diagnosed with cancer in the following year[1] after which period the risk of an occult cancer diagnosis is similar to the general population.  ,/wiki/SOME,,
Among patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease without prior treatment with immunosuppressive therapies or biologics does azathioprine infliximab or a combination of both therapies improve rates of steroid-free remission?,The efficacy of the chimeric anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody infliximab in maintenance therapy for Crohn disease was established in ACCENT I (2002)[1] and ACCENT II (2004).[2] A trial demonstrating its efficacy as an induction agent was lacking.,/wiki/SONIC,,
In patients with moderate to severe chronic back or osteoarthritic hip/knee pain despite analgesic use does opioid compared to non-opioid medication therapy result in better pain-related function?,Opioids became widely prescribed for chronic pain starting in the 1990s largely driven by intensive marketing strategies by pharmaceutical companies like Purdue (led by the Sackler family).[1] Increasing availability of highly abusable opioids has been identified as a major driver of the opioid epidemic. In the US alone overdose deaths grew from 17000/year in 1999 to 70000/year in 2017.[2] Despite the widespread prescription of opioids their efficacy for chronic pain was unknown. ,/wiki/SPACE,,
Among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation does the use of warfarin or aspirin reduce the risk of stroke compared to placebo?,We take for granted that aspirin warfarin and other anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF. Yet establishing these as standards of care required thoughtfully designed large placebo-controlled studies. In the 1980s there was sufficient clinical equipoise to carry out such a placebo-controlled trial which led to the SPAF group of studies.,/wiki/SPAF,,
In patients with prior stroke or TIA does high-dose atorvastatin reduce the risk of recurrent stroke?,Stroke and TIA are well established complications of CV disease and prior studies such as the CARE LIPID and 4S trials helped establish the role of statins in primary prevention of stroke and TIA among patients at high risk of cerebrovascular disease. However prior to SPARCL the role of statins in secondary prevention of stroke and TIA was not well established.,/wiki/SPARCL,,
In critically ill adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation does the use of dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative as compared to usual care with other sedatives lead to improvements in mortality?,The newer sedative dexmedetomidine has desirable properties such as providing analgesia without depressing respiratory drive may produce lighter sedation and may cause delirium less frequently than other agents.[1] Direct comparisons between sedation with dexmedetomidine versus other agents was lacking.,/wiki/SPICE_III,,
In patients at high risk for CVD but who do not have a history of stroke or diabetes does intensive BP control (target SBP <120 mm Hg) yield superior CV outcomes compared to standard treatment (target SBP 135-139 mm Hg)?,'Systolic hypertension (SBP ≥140 mm Hg) and prehypertension (SBP 120-139 mm Hg) are risk factors for myriad diseases including CAD CKD and stroke.[1][2][3] Treatment conventions and guideline statements have called for the treatment of hypertension to a target SBP of <140 mm Hg but no large trial had demonstrated this in a well-designed randomized fashion and it has been largely unknown whether more intensive therapy would be more efficacious. ACCORD BP (2010) demonstrated that among patients with diabetes intensive therapy (target SBP <120 mm Hg) yielded no improvement in CV outcomes compared to standard therapy (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Similarly SPS3-BP [4] found no reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with recent lacunar stroke randomized to intensive (target SBP <130 mm Hg) versus conventional therapy (target SBP 130-150 mm Hg). But what of patients without known CVD or CVD risk equivalents such as diabetes? That is it be that intensive therapy could benefit high-risk patients who haven''t already had complications of CVD such as stroke?',/wiki/SPRINT,,
Among patients with recent lacunar strokes does the administration of clopidogrel+ASA reduce rates of subsequent strokes when compared to ASA monotherapy? ,The efficacy of single-agent antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention is well established particularly for ASA in many trials [1][2][3][4][5] (including IST) and for clopidogrel in the subgroup analysis of the CAPRIE trial. However the role of dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) in secondary stroke prevention is currently unclear. ,/wiki/SPS3_Clopidogrel-ASA,,
In patients with a recent lacunar stroke does lower-target BP control (target SBP <130 mm Hg) reduce incident stroke when compared to higher-target BP control (target SBP 140-150 mmHg)?,Lacunar strokes are infarcts <20 mm in diameter located in territories classically supplied by cerebral small vessels (40–200 μm in diameter) such as the centrum semiovale corona radiata internal capsule thalamus or ventral pons.[1] Hypertension is a well-recognized risk factor for the development of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes and is one of the only modifiable risk factors of cerebral small vessel disease[2] a process associated with lacunar strokes deep intra-cerebral hemorrhages and vascular dementia. Because of the close association of cerebral small vessel disease with hypertension there is particular interest in determining whether stricter BP control after lacunar strokes would prevent subsequent strokes. ,/wiki/SPS3-BP,,
Among patients with uncontrolled hypertension (office SBP 150-180mmHg and DBP ≥ 90mmHg as well as 24h ambulatory SBP 140-170mmHg) despite 1-3 antihypertensive medications is renal denervation with medical therapy superior to medical therapy alone in reducing blood pressure?,The use of renal denervation to modulate sympathethic tone as a means of treating hypertension has been the topic of multiple previous studies. However trials of variable size design and method have demonstrated inconsistent efficacy.[1][2][3] Recently the SPYRAL HTN-OFF MED trial showed significant and meaningful blood pressure reductions in a group of hypertensive patients not receiving medical therapy. However the potential role of renal denervation as a means to augment blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension despite medical therapy - the role in which renal denervation is most likely to be utilized clinically - remains largely unknown.,/wiki/SPYRAL_HTN-ON_MED,,
In obese patients with uncontrolled T2DM does bariatric surgery plus intensive medical therapy improve HbA1c better than intensive medical therapy alone? ,The use of bariatric surgery to treat and potentially reverse diabetes mellitus has been an attractive proposal for some time.[1] Bariatric surgery results in reversal of diabetes in a majority of selected obese patients with T2DM (>70%) and is associated with minimal perioperative mortality.[2] These observations prompted a number of randomized studies of weight-loss surgery in obese diabetic patients.,/wiki/STAMPEDE,,
In postmenopausal women how does tamoxifen compare to raloxifene in primary breast cancer prevention and side effect profile?,Numerous placebo-controlled studies of women including NSABP P-1 (1998) MORE[1] (1999) and CORE (2004) have demonstrated a reduction in the risk of breast cancer with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and raloxifene. Large prospective head-to-head comparisons of tamoxifen a first generation agent and raloxifene a second generation agent had not yet been performed.,/wiki/STAR,,
Among patients with unipolar major depression without psychotic features how often is remission achieved when using a tiered protocol?,The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR-D) trial employed a four-step treatment protocol to outpatients with non-psychotic depression with total remission as the goal. Step 1 was citalopram only. Those with remission were entered into a 12-month follow up protocol. Those who did not attain remission were randomly enrolled in step 2 treatment which consisted of 7 different treatment options. The equipoise stratified design allowed patients to choose a switch or augmentation strategy for steps 2 and 3.,/wiki/STAR-D,,
In patients with obesity but without diabetes does use of the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide result in significant weight loss?,Obesity is an increasingly common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.[1][2] Lifestyle modification is the mainstay of therapy as adjunctive pharmacologic therapies for weight loss are limited. Among these is liraglutide a GLP-1 receptor agonist administered as a daily subcutaneous injection approved for weight management based on the SCALE trial. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue previously approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes which has been associated with increased weight loss in diabetic patients compared to liraglutide.[3],/wiki/STEP_1,,
Among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ≤35% does OMT plus CABG improve mortality compared to OMT alone?,The CASS trial (1985) demonstrated no overall survival benefit with CABG compared to OMT among patients with stable CAD. However survival was improved in a subset of patients with systolic dysfunction and 3-vessel coronary disease.  Optimal therapy for patients with severe CAD and LV dysfunction had not been formally addressed in larger randomized trials and data among patients with more severe LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤35%) had been limited.,/wiki/STICH,,
Among patients with advanced indolent lymphomas how does first-line therapy with rituximab-bendamustine (BR) compare to rituximab cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone (R-CHOP) in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS) and toxicity profile?,'Although head-to-head comparisons with other regimens are lacking R-CHOP forms the backbone of treatment for many types of lymphomas in the US including the indolent lymphomas. Bendamustine has been used widely in Germany since the 1970s for patients with lymphoid malignancies with a favorable efficacy and toxicity profile. Bendamustine has pharmacologic properties of an alkylator and purine analog and this dual function may enhance its efficacy as a single agent. Bendamustine''s FDA approval for relapsed or refractory rituximab-resistant indolent lymphomas was based on a study published in 2010 that demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 75% and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.3 months with single-agent bendamustine.[1] Combination therapy with bendamustine-rituximab (BR) appeared superior to single-agent bendamustine based on a single-arm phase II study in which combination BR demonstrated an ORR of 92% and median PFS of 23 months.[2] As in the German experience both efficacy and tolerability were excellent. Efforts were therefore focused on bringing BR into front-line therapy and a phase III study comparing BR to R-CHOP was necessary.',/wiki/StiL,,
In patients with intraabdominal infections does a shorter course of antibiotics (3-5 days) increase the risk of surgical-site infection recurrent intraabdominal infection or death within 30 days?,The optimal duration of antibiotics for intraabdominal infections is not known.  Traditionally therapy is continued until SIRS markers have resolved (typically 7-14 days) but courses as short as 3-5 days may be equally efficacious and more in keeping with antibiotic stewardship cost containment and other goals. IDSA guidelines in 2010 recommended 4-7 days though this recommendation was based on relatively low-quality evidence.[1] There was a critical need to assess varying durations of anticoagulation in this patient population. ,/wiki/STOP-IT,,
In patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis does treatment with prednisolone or pentoxifylline reduce mortality at 28 days?,The limited research into effective therapies for alcoholic hepatitis has primarily focused on prednisolone and pentoxifylline. For prednisolone a 2008 Cochran review [1] showed a trend towards benefit with glucocorticoid treatment. This was supported in a 2011 meta-analysis of the five largest studies which showed a mortality benefit with prednisolone treatment.[2] The evidence for pentoxifylline is less well established with meta-analyses failing to show benefit.[3] The evidence supporting the use of pentoxifylline comes from a single trial showing improved mortality with administration (see Pentoxifylline in Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis 2000).,/wiki/STOPAH,,
In patients with a life expectancy of <1 year does discontinuing statin therapy for cardiovascular disease increase 60 day all-cause mortality when compared to continuation of statin therapy?,Statins are widely used for primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD with modern guidelines recommending use of the medication class should individuals be at an elevated 10 year risk of ASCVD.[1] For individuals with a limited life span the medications are of unclear benefit. ,/wiki/Stopping_Statins_at_the_End_of_Life,,
Among adult patients emergently admitted to an ICU with an increased risk for GI bleed does administration of acid-suppressive therapy with the PPI pantoprazole alter mortality at 90 days when compared to placebo?,Critical illness is associated with upper GI bleeding which may be exacerbated by gut dysmotility inability to tolerate enteral feedings and development of stress ulcers. Historically these issues have been addressed by routinely delaying enteral nutrition and by routinely using prophylactic acid suppression in critically ill patients. Routine stress ulcer prophylaxis may be associated with infectious complications including C. difficile-associated diarrhea pneumonia and death.[1][2] Strong evidence supporting the routine use of PPIs was lacking. ,/wiki/SUP-ICU,,
In patients with severe symptomatic Aortic Stenosis (AS) at intermediate surgical risk how does transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) compare to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in safety and efficacy?,TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) is an emerging therapy for severe AS in which an aortic valve prosthesis is inserted percutaneously rather than during via thoracotomy as in surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The two TAVR valves in current use include the balloon-expandable Sapien XT valve and the self-expanding CoreValve. On the strength of landmark RCTs including PARTNER A PARTNER B and the Core Valve High Risk Study [1] TAVR has emerged as an acceptable alternative to SAVR in patients who are either not candidates for surgery or at high surgical risk. More recently PARTNER 2 demonstrated that the balloon-expandable Sapien XT TAVR was noninferior to SAVR in patients even at only intermediate risk for surgery with similar rates of a composite outcome of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke at 2 years. A similar trial demonstrating the comparative safety and efficacy of the self-expandable CoreValve TAVR to SAVR in intermediate-risk patients was needed.,/wiki/SURTAVI,,
In patients with sickle cell disease how does the P-selectin inhibitor crizanlizumab (SelG1) impact the rate of sickle cell-related pain crises compared to placebo?,Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting P-selectin an adhesion molecule thought to be important in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease-related vasoocclusive events. In the randomized phase 2 SUSTAIN trial 192 patients with sickle cell disease complicated by ≥2 painful crises in the prior year (63% with 2-4 crises) and on a stable medication regimen (62% receiving hydroxyurea) were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to high-dose crizanlizumab low-dose crizanlizumab or placebo. Treatment was given on week zero week two and then every four weeks thereafter for a total of one year. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of pain crises defined as a vasoocclusive episode resulting in treatment with a parenteral analgesic; types of crises included acute chest syndrome hepatic sequestration splenic sequestration and priapism although these latter types of crises were rare. In the intention-to-treat analysis patients in the high-dose crizanlizumab group had a median crisis rate per year of 1.63 compared to 2.98 in the placebo group representing a 45% relative reduction. There was no significant difference in the rate of crises between the low-dose crizanlizumab group and the placebo group. The proportion of patients without any sickle cell pain crises during the year-long study period was higher in the high-dose crizanlizumab group compared to placebo (36% vs. 17%). In subgroup analyses considering genotype baseline hydroxyurea use and baseline frequency of crises patients in the crizanlizumab group consistently appeared to benefit more than those in the placebo group.[1][2] High-dose crizanlizumab was generally well tolerated with a higher proportion of patients experiencing arthralgias (18%) pyrexia (11%) and diarrhea (11%) compared to those in the placebo group. Additionally the package insert for crizanlizumab suggests monitoring for infusion-related reactions and indicates that platelet clumping may occur. Quality of life (QOL) data were collected during the study period; figures were not reported in the manuscript or supplement but the authors reported that between-group differences tended to be small. ,/wiki/SUSTAIN,,
In patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma does cytoreductive nephrectomy followed by interferon therapy result in longer survival than interferon alone?,Prior to this study it was not known whether cytoreductive nephrectomy which is the removal of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic RCC would improve clinical outcomes in this patient population. Retrospective studies suggested a benefit but reported rates of surgical morbidity and mortality were prohibitively high in early small series of patients treated with this approach. This was the first randomized trial to demonstrate that cytoreductive nephrectomy was safe and improves survival in metastatic RCC when followed by interferon alfa immunotherapy.,/wiki/SWOG_8949,,
Among patients with alcohol withdrawal is there a benefit to symptom-based therapy compared to fixed-schedule benzodiazepines?,Strategies for the acute management of alcohol withdrawal range widely with some favoring scheduled benzodiazepines others favoring scheduled alpha-antagonists and antiepileptics and still others preferring a symptom-based approach. This study compared scheduled benzodiazepines to as-needed benzodiazepines given according to the revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale[1] finding that the symptom-based approach resulted in shorter hospitalizations and fewer benzodiazepines given and was not associated with an increase in adverse events. A major criticism was the small study size (117) which rendered adverse events such as seizures as very rare. Additionally the study was conducted at acute inpatient psychiatric alcohol withdrawal units and may not generalize to inpatient medicine wards.,/wiki/Symptom-Triggered_Benzodiazepines_in_Alcohol_Withdrawal,,
Among patients with 3-vessel and/or left main disease how does PCI compare with CABG in terms of rates of major CV events?,The Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) Trial randomized 1800 patients with 3-vessel and/or left main CAD to either PCI with paclitaxel-eluting stents or CABG. SYNTAX demonstrated that major CV events occurred more frequently in the PCI arm (17.8% vs. 12.4%) which was driven primarily by the increased frequency of repeat revascularization procedures in patients treated with PCI (13.5% vs. 5.9%).  However there were more strokes in the CABG arm (0.6% vs. 2.2%).,/wiki/SYNTAX,,
In patients with unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation MI does an early invasive PCI strategy reduce major cardiovascular events versus a more conservative selectively invasive PCI strategy?,Unlike patients presenting with STEMI in which there is a clear mortality benefit to emergent coronary angiography and PCI it is less clear whether patients with non-STEMI ACS (unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation MI) also benefit from routine early angiography and intervention. ,/wiki/TACTICS-TIMI_18,,
In patients with poorly controlled asthma currently using an inhaled corticosteroid alone does the addition of tiotropium improve symptoms and lung function when compared to increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid or adding a long-acting beta-agonist? ,Current treatment options for patients whose asthma is poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy include adding a LABA or montelukast or increasing the ICS dose. Short- and long-acting anticholinergic agents which are approved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had been hypothesized to improve outcomes in asthmatic patients but their utility compared to LABAs had not been prospectively studied in a large trial. ,/wiki/TALC,,
Among patients presenting with unstable angina or NSTEMI does early intervention with coronary angiography (≤24 h after randomization) improve outcomes compared to delayed intervention (≥36 h)?,"Numerous randomized controlled trials including FRISC-II RITA-3 and TACTICS-TIMI 18 have demonstrated the benefit of early invasive intervention with angiography in high-risk patients with unstable angina (UA) and NSTEMI. While these trials have shown the life-saving benefit of early intervention in UA and NSTEMI the exact timing of intervention had not been clearly established — what constitutes ""early""? Prior to this trial observational studies had suggested lower rates of complications in patients undergoing PCI ≥48 h of medical therapy with the hypothesis that this ""cooling-off"" strategy allows for plaque stabilization and better interventional outcomes.

Among pregnant women with a thrombophilia does antepartum prophylactic dalteparin reduce the risk of pregnancy complications including venous thromboembolism pregnancy loss or placenta-mediated pregnancy complications?,Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state associated with venous thromboembolism. Moreover microvascular thrombosis has long been considered a driver of pregnancy-related complications including pregnancy loss placental insufficiency intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia. Early anecdotes and smaller studies suggested a potential benefit to antepartum anticoagulation in reducing rates of thrombosis pregnancy loss and other pregnancy-related complications but a randomized trial was needed.,/wiki/TIPPS,,
Among patients with stable CAD and hyperlipidemia does atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily have a greater reduction in CAD mortality non-fatal MI not related to procedures resuscitation after cardiac arrest or fatal or nonfatal stroke when compared to atorvastatin 10 mg PO daily?,Trials like 4S (1994) CARE (1996) LIPID (1998) and HPS (2002) established statins as effective in secondary prevention in patients with CAD and hyperlipidemia. However the ideal statin choice and LDL goal in these patients was not known. PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (2004) demonstrated a reduction in CV complications with high-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily) over moderate-intensity (pravastatin 40 mg PO daily) in patients with recent ACS. Whether high-intensity statin therapy would benefit patients with stable CAD and hyperlipidemia was unknown.,/wiki/TNT,,
Among seniors with hypertension do non-pharmacologic approaches like sodium reduction and weight loss help in treatment of hypertension?,Dietary and behavioral interventions have been shown to reduce blood pressure. For example the DASH diet and the DASH+Low Sodium diet[1] have previously shown efficacy similar to or greater than a single blood pressure agent. In the mid-1990s evidence was lacking for the role of behavioral non-pharmacological strategies for reduction of blood pressure among older adults. ,/wiki/TONE,,
Among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction does spironolactone reduce CV mortality aborted cardiac arrest or HF hospitalizations when compared to placebo?,The efficacy of aldosterone antagonists in reducing mortality for those with HFrEF was demonstrated in RALES (1999; spironolactone) and EMPHASIS-HF  (2011; eplerenone). In contrast to the multiple effective regimens for HFrEF (e.g. beta blockers ACE-inhibitors/ARBs aldosterone antagonists) few therapies improve outcomes for HFpEF. Aldosterone antagonists had not been studied in a large RCT involving patients with HFpEF.,/wiki/TOPCAT,,
In patients with COPD what are the effects of combination therapy with salmeterol and fluticasone propionate on mortality?,Published in 2007 the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) trial studied 6112 patients with COPD randomized to salmeterol/fluticasone salmeterol fluticasone or placebo. At 3 years of follow-up all active treatments slowed lung function decline and improved health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Combination salmeterol/fluticasone was associated with a 25% reduction in exacerbations corresponding to a NNT of 4 to prevent one exacerbation in 1 year and a 17% reduction in COPD-related hospitalizations corresponding to a NNT of 32 to prevent one hospitalization in 1 year. Of note this is counter-balanced by a 49% increased risk of pneumonia associated with inhaled steroid therapy corresponding to a NNH of 17.,/wiki/TORCH,,
In patients with an upper GI bleed how does a restrictive transfusion goal compare with a liberal transfusion goal in regards to mortality?,TRICC (1999) changed transfusion practices among critically ill patients when it demonstrated improved survival with a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hgb ≥7 g/dL).  However actively bleeding patients were excluded from TRICC and the Hgb threshold for transfusion in patients with acute UGIB was controversial.  ,/wiki/Transfusion_Strategies_for_Acute_Upper_Gastrointestinal_Bleeding,,
In high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome is rivaroxaban non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolic events major bleeding and vascular death?,Rivaroxaban has been found to be noninferior to warfarin in the treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (ROCKET AF) and noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE or bleeding in patients with acute PE (EINSTEIN-PE) but the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of its use in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) had not been rigorously studied. The 2016 RAPS study[1] evaluated rivaroxaban among 116 adults with low-risk APLS and studied a surrogate endpoint of endogenous thrombin potential. There were too few events to determine clinical efficacy of rivaroxaban among this population. Demonstrating equivalence or superiority of rivaroxaban in higher-risk adults would provide clinical evidence for the use of a factor Xa inhibitor in APLS. ,/wiki/TRAPS,,
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus chronic kidney disease and anemia what is the efficacy of erythrocyte-stimulating agents in decreasing mortality CV events or advancement to ESRD?,Erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESA) increase hemoglobin concentration though their effects on clinical outcomes in non-dialysis-dependent patients was unclear. The 2006 CHOIR trial demonstrated an increased risk of HF and hospitalizations in patients with CKD randomized to ESA therapy targeting a hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL when compared to a target of 11.3 g/dL. CREATE[1] demonstrated that higher hemoglobin targets were associated with more rapid progression to ESRD. ESAs did not appear to influence the rate of CV events.,/wiki/TREAT,,
In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy whose symptoms and cardiac function recover does withdrawing medications increase the likelihood of relapsing dilated cardiomyopathy?,A significant proportion of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have their symptoms resolve and ejection fraction recover with medical therapy.[1][2] Compared to patients with persistently reduced EF patients with recovered EF have better outcomes.[3] It is unclear whether this represents temporary remission or complete recovery of cardiac muscle dysfunction where medical therapy could be safely withdrawn. Evidence is lacking to guide the decision; a systematic review by Hopper et al featured 11 randomised trials and concluded that withdrawal of heart failure medications increased the risk of recurrence.[4],/wiki/TRED-HF,,
Among critically ill patients how does a restrictive transfusion strategy (hemoglobin goal of 7-9 g/dL) compare with a liberal transfusion strategy (hemoglobin goal of 10-12 g/dL) in decreasing mortality? ,The Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial randomized 838 patients admitted to the ICU without evidence of active bleeding to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion to maintain hemoglobin >7 g/dL) versus a liberal strategy (transfusion to maintain hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL).  The study enrolled patients who were euvolemic after initial fluid resuscitation.  There was adequate separation between the two groups with an average hemoglobin 8.5 vs. 10.7 g/dL respectively.  The restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with decreased rates of in-hospital mortality compared to those seen with the liberal transfusion strategy.  This benefit was most prominent among the less critically ill patients (APACHE II score ≤20) and <55 years old.  However in the restrictive arm there was a trend towards improved outcomes in patients with active cardiac ischemia.,/wiki/TRICC,,
In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who have a moderate-to-high risk of death is a restrictive transfusion strategy applied throughout the perioperative period noninferior to a liberal transfusion strategy in terms of major morbidities and mortality?,'Red-cell transfusions can be life-saving in many contexts but unnecessary transfusions carry considerable morbidity and mortality. A growing body of evidence from randomized data supports more restrictive transfusion thresholds among patients in the ICU (TRICC) with sepsis (TRISS) and in acute upper GI hemorrhage. There is limited data supporting a particular transfusion threshold in the surgical setting. FOCUS for example demonstrated that among patients undergoing hip surgery a liberal strategy provided no benefit over a more restrictive approach. Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery the TITRe2 trial[1] raised concerns because a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with increased 90-day mortality compared to a liberal strategy. That result coupled with limitation in the study''s design prompted additional studies.',/wiki/TRICS_III,,
In patients with septic shock how does a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hgb ≤ 7 g/dL) compare with a liberal transfusion strategy (Hgb ≤ 9 g/dL) in terms of 90-day mortality?,Transfusion thresholds have been much contested. The 1999 TRICC trial demonstrated decreased rates of in-hospital mortality with a restrictive transfusion strategy as compared to a liberal transfusion strategy establishing the paradigm for transfusion at 7 g/dL among euvolemic ICU patients. The study enrolled patients who were hemodynamically stable after initial fluid resuscitation but excluded patients with septic shock. In patients with septic shock the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a high threshold of transfusion to maintain Hct >30% or Hgb >10 g/dL during the first 6 hours if hypoperfusion is present [1].  However this intervention has been questioned in light of data that more transfusions may be harmful to critically ill patients.,/wiki/TRISS,,
In patients with ACS and scheduled PCI does prasugrel reduce CV morbidity and mortality when compared to clopidogrel?,'Clopidogrel''s use in ACS was evaluated in CURE (2001) CLARITY-TIMI 28 (2005)[1] and ARMYDA-2 (2005)[2] and remains the standard of care in ACS. Prasugrel a newer thienopyridine is thought to have more potent and rapid platelet inhibition with less variability.[3]',/wiki/TRITON-TIMI_38,,
Among patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria does the anti-complement monoclonal antibody eculizumab stabilize hemoglobin levels and decrease RBC transfusion requirements when compared to placebo?,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disorder characterized by complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. PNH classically results from a mutation of the PIGA gene resulting in deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) a glycolipid responsible for anchoring >100 different proteins to the cell membrane. Complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59 are two such proteins anchored on the RBC membrane preventing the formation of the terminal complement complex on RBCs. In patients with PNH CD55 and CD59 are lacking and RBCs undergo excessive complement-mediated hemolysis leading to hemolytic anemia thrombosis renal dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.[1][2] The name of the disease derives from a perceived increase in hemolysis with subsequent hemoglobinuria at night.[3] Historically therapy relied on stem cell transplant for eligible patients as well as palliative RBC transfusions. ,/wiki/TRIUMPH,,
For patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest does hypothermia to a goal of 33°C reduce all-cause mortality when compared to a goal of 36°C?,Two randomized controlled trials in 2002 (Bernard et al.[1] and HACA) demonstrated a survival and neurologic benefit with therapeutic hypothermia (now called targeted temperature management or TTM) with goal of 32-34°C in patients experiencing out-of-hospital VF or pulseless VT arrest. The AHA guidelines now recommend TTM for comatose patients following out-of-hospital VF arrest (class I level B) and consideration of the therapy following out-of-hospital asystole or PEA arrest and any in-hospital arrest (class IIb level B).[2] However the therapy is not without complications as lower temperatures are associated with decreased cardiac output infection electrolyte abnormalities and need for sedation. Furthermore the evidence for these interventions was derived from relatively small trials in a population not treated by modern critical care practices. As such the ideal target temperature for treatment following ROSC after cardiac arrest have not been established.,/wiki/TTM,,
In adult patients with coma following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest does targeted hypothermia improve survival and performance outcomes compared to normothermia?,Animal studies and early clinical trials in humans suggested a benefit to hypothermia over normothermia after cardiac arrest. For example the HACA trial (2002) found that targeted hypothermia to 33°C was associated with improved survival and neurologic outcomes in patients with cardiac arrest and a shockable rhythm (eg either VF or pulseless VT). The more recent HYPERION study (2019) compared 33°C to 37°C in patients with non-shockable rhythms finding favorable outcomes in the hypothermia group. A 2012 Cochrane review suggested that mild hypothermia likely improves survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest.[1] In contrast the TTM trial (2013) enrolled patients with cardiac arrest and either a shockable or non-shockable rhythm finding no differences in survival or neurologic outcomes between hypothermia (33°C) and normothermia (36°C) groups.,/wiki/TTM2,,
Among patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) receiving standard chemotherapy how does twice-daily radiotherapy compare to once-daily radiotherapy in terms of overall survival? ,Concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin/etoposide is the treatment of choice for limited-stage SCLC but the optimal dosing strategy of radiotherapy (RT) remains uncertain. Some studies of various fractionation schedules yielded promising results with a twice-daily regimen. The rationale for twice-daily RT hinges on the exponential rate of death of small-cell lung cancer cells when exposed to RT and the relatively rapid rate of tumor cell repair between RT fractions. Thus an accelerated twice-daily schedule with a lower radiation dose per fraction may still provide sufficient tumor death while limiting tumor growth between treatments. However studies of twice-daily regimens had yielded conflicting results prompting this follow-up randomized study.,/wiki/Twice-daily_RT_for_SCLC,,
Among adults with newly diagnosed T2DM what is the effect of intensive glycemic control with a sulfonylurea or insulin therapy on glycemic control and the complications of diabetes compared to diet alone?,Prior to UKPDS the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) the only large-scale RCT to investigate the role of glycemic control on macrovascular outcomes in T2DM demonstrated no macrovascular benefit with sulfonylureas.  However it revealed an unexpected increase in cardiovascular mortality with the sulfonylrea tolbutamine.,/wiki/UKPDS_33,,
Among overweight patients with T2DM does metformin reduce DM-related complications and all-cause mortality when compared to diet or other early antiglycemic agents?,'Biguanides have many theoretical benefits over other agents in the treatment of T2DM including reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis decreasing plasma insulin levels and facilitating weight loss. However the biguanide phenformin was associated with increased CV and all-cause mortality in UGDP (1975)[1] and is no longer used in clinical practice. The related agent metformin subsequently became the subject of intense interest but studies of metformin''s effect on clinical endpoints were lacking.',/wiki/UKPDS_34,,
In patients with COPD what are the effects of tioptropium on the rate of decline in lung function exacerbations related hospitalizations and mortality?,The Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) trial investigated whether the long-acting anticholinergic drug tiotropium would decrease the rate of decline in FEV1 among patients with COPD. UPLIFT did not show an improvement in this primary endpoint but it did show that tiotropium was associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations and a trend towards decreased 4-year mortality.,/wiki/UPLIFT,,
In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and systolic heart failure does vasodilator therapy with isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN)/hydralazine confer a survival benefit?,In the early 1980s vasodilator therapy was in reasonably wide use among individuals with symptomatic systolic heart failure based upon its favorable hemodynamic effects. However its effect on mortality had not been studied until the VA Cooperative Study investigators undertook the V-HeFT trial.,/wiki/V-HeFT,,
Among patients with mild-to-moderate HFrEF on diuretics and digoxin does enalapril improve survival compared to the combination of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and hydralazine?,In the era before ACE inhibitors the V-HeFT trial demonstrated that vasodilator therapy with ISDN/hydralazine conferred a modest survival benefit in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Subsequently CONSENSUS (1987) demonstrated a survival benefit with ACE inhibition in patients with severe class IV heart failure. Until V-HeFT II no study prospectively compared survival with ACE inhibitors versus ISDN/hydralazine in patients with less severe HFrEF.,/wiki/V-HeFT_II,,
In men with unstable angina (UA) what is the effect of aspirin on acute MI and mortality?,Unstable angina is associated with transient ischemia due at least in part to enhanced platelet activity and therefore may be reversed in part by antiplatelet agents. The VA Cooperative Study sought to address the reversability of UA demonstrating that aspirin reduced the risk of death or MI at 12 weeks by 50% with an associated NNT of 20. This provides evidence supporting the routine use of aspirin not only in patients with MI but in all patients with acute coronary syndrome including UA.,/wiki/VA_Cooperative_Study,,
In patients with T2DM CKD stage 2-3 and elevated urine albumin:creatinine does the addition of an ACE inhibitor to ARB therapy prevent eGFR reduction ESRD or death? ,The 1993 CSG Captopril Trial demonstrated that the ACE inhibitor captopril prevented progression of DM nephropathy in patients with T1DM. The 2001 RENAAL trial demonstrated efficacy of the ARB losartan in patients with T2DM nephropathy. Whether adding an ACE inhibitor to ARB therapy would provide further benefit in T2DM with DM nephropathy and was unknown.,/wiki/VA-NEPHRON_D,,
Among individuals with poorly-controlled T2DM does intensive glycemic control reduce the risk of macrovascular complications?,Some 60% of type 2 diabetics die of cardiovascular (CV) complications; thus many diabetes initiatives seek to investigate the role of glycemic control in reducing the risk of these macrovascular events. Several trials in T2DM have studied the impact of intensive glycemic therapy on macrovascular and microvascular outcomes often with mixed results. UKPDS 33 (1998) ACCORD (2008) ADVANCE (2008) and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT; 2009) were among the largest of these trials. UKPDS showed a similar reduction in microvascular complications and was the first to demonstrate a nonsignificant trend towards reduced CV risks among those treated with intensive glycemic therapy. However ACCORD failed to demonstrate a reduction in CV events with intensive therapy and actually suggested that intensive therapy may be associated with increased mortality. Similarly ADVANCE failed to demonstrate a CV benefit with intensive therapy; however it did show a modest reduction in albuminuria a surrogate for microvascular complications.,/wiki/VADT,,
In patients with HFrEF and NHYA class II-IV symptoms what is the efficacy of valsartan in addition to standard therapy in decreasing morbidity and mortality?,ACE inhibitors became the standard of care in HFrEF management following publication of CONSENSUS (1987) and SOLVD (1991). Beta blockers joined a decade later with publication of CIBIS-II (1999) MERIT-HF (1999) and COPERNICUS (2002). The role of ARBs was not clear in this disease.,/wiki/Val-HeFT,,
Among patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 does sofosbuvir plus ribavirin result in sustained virologic response?,'Historically approximately three-quarters of patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 treated with peginterferon alfa-2a (IFN) plus ribavirin achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR).[1] However IFN-related toxicities including influenza-like symptoms depression anemia thrombocytopenia and autoimmune thyroiditis were prohibitive.[2] In the 2010s novel antiviral therapies were being developed including the viral RNA synthesis inhibitor sofosbuvir with marked efficacy and reasonable tolerability. Sofosbuvir''s single-agent activity and its efficacy in combination with ribavirin led to a flurry of publications touting an IFN-free cure for HCV. Its use in North America and other centers in the FISSION studies[3] established sofosbuvir-ribavirin as a reasonable IFN-sparing regimen among patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3.',/wiki/VALENCE,,
Among patients in the post-MI period complicated by HF and/or LV systolic dysfunction what is the efficacy of ARBs compared with ACE-I in improving survival?,The SAVE (1992) trial established the survival benefit of ACE-inhibitor therapy in patients after MI with HF and/or LV systolic dysfunction.  The two major trials that compared ARBs to ACE-inhibitors among high-risk patients after MI were OPTIMAAL and VALIANT.,/wiki/VALIANT,,
In patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea how does metronidazole compare with vancomycin in regards to effecting a cure and preventing relapse?,After the millennium it was unclear whether vancomycin or metronidazole should be preferred for first-line treatment of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Earlier data suggested equivalence of the two agents but these studies were small and non-blinded. There remained many concerns over the blanket administration of vancomycin for CDAD a frequent occurrence with over one-quarter of infectious disease specialists recommending vancomycin as first-line therapy. Among these concerns was the rise of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).,/wiki/Vancomycin_vs._Metronidazole_in_C._difficile_Diarrhea,,
In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) while on first-line antiarrhythmic therapy does VT ablation reduce death VT storm and appropriate ICD shocks compared to escalation of antiarrhythmic drugs?,On the strength of RCTs such as AVID SCD-HeFT and MADIT-II ICD placement is now considered standard of care in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF ≤35% and/or a previous episode of VT/VF arrest. Despite the mortality benefit provided by ICDs in this setting recurrent VT remains a significant problem as up to 38% of these patients receive an appropriate ICD shock over the 5 years following ICD placement.[1] Although ICDs are effective in terminating VT and aborting cardiac arrest ICD shocks have been associated with an increased risk of death heart failure and hospitalization.[2] As a result addition of antiarrhythmic drugs is often utilized in this setting in an attempt to suppress VT and reduce ICD shocks. If VT recurs despite antiarrhythmic therapy patients often undergo escalation of antiarrhythmic therapy or consideration of VT ablation. There is emerging evidence that VT ablation is effective in reducing the incidence of recurrent VT and that VT-free survival after VT ablation is associated with improved mortality.[3] Nevertheless the comparative efficacy of escalation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy versus VT ablation in the setting of drug-refractory VT is unknown.,/wiki/VANISH,,
Among patients with septic shock on a catecholamine vasopressor does addition of low-dose vasopressin reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days when compared to addition of norepinephrine?,Septic shock is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Treatment focuses on early administration of antibiotics and maintaining blood pressure above a MAP of 65 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors like catecholamines (eg norpepinephrine) or the hormone vasopressin (also called antidiuretic hormone or arginine vasopressin). Vasopressin is thought to elevate blood pressure through smooth muscle V1 receptor-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction.[1] However this vasoconstriction may result in decreased organ perfusion which can be particularly detrimental in the setting of cardiac ischemia. Despite its popularity as a medication the safety and efficacy of vasopressin had not been demonstrated in a large clinical trial.,/wiki/VASST,,
In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF ≤35%) due to acute myocardial infarction do wearable cardioverter-defibrillators (WCDs) reduce arrhythmic death compared to medical therapy?,It is well-known that patients with acute ischemic cardiomyopathy resulting in LVEF ≤ 35% are at relatively high risk for arrhythmic death in the immediate post-MI period. However studies investigating the efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) shortly after an MI (DINAMIT) or after multivessel revascularization (CABG-PATCH) have failed to demonstrate a benefit. ,/wiki/VEST,,
Among patients with septic shock does intravenous administration of vitamin C thiamine and hydrocortisone lead to faster resolution of septic shock than hydrocortisone alone?,There are limited therapeutic options in the management of septic shock and identifying methods to reduce mortality from this condition is imperative.[1] Several small or low-quality studies (ie non-RCTs) assessed the potential role of vitamin B1 (thiamine) and C in populations with sepsis. One study found a possible reduction in SOFA scores and inflammatory biomarkers with vitamin C administration.[2] One reported lower thiamine levels among patients with sepsis.[3] One reported lower mortality and improved lactate clearance among a cohort treated with thiamine relative to controls not treated with thiamine.[4] The most famous was a 2017 study (on this site known as Hydrocortisone Vitamin C and Thiamine in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock) that reported lower hospital mortality and reduced amount of time requiring vasopressors among a cohort treated with vitamin C thiamine and hydrocortisone relative to historical comparisons. An RCT was needed to identify an actual role for these agents.,/wiki/VITAMINS,,
In patients with unprovoked VTE who have completed anticoagulation does aspirin reduce the risk of recurrent VTE?,After 3-6 months of oral anticoagulation for a first unprovoked episode of VTE the 1-year risk of recurrence is approximately 11%.[1] This trial studied low-dose aspirin as secondary VTE prophylaxis among patients that had completed anticoagulation.,/wiki/WARFASA,,
In patients with a recent TIA or non-disabling stroke and intracranial artery stenosis of 50 to 99% does medical treatment with warfarin improve mortality and decrease risk for further cerebrovascular events compared with aspirin?,Since the widespread adoption of CT and MR angiography for acute stroke management leading to more frequent detection of intracranial atherosclerosis the best management of symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis for secondary stroke prevention needed to be addressed. The clinical equipoise stemmed from the fact that prior to the WASID trial several retrospective papers suggested a possible benefit of warfarin over aspirin for the stroke prevention in this population[1][2] but the WARSS trial (2001)[3] suggested aspirin and warfarin were equivalent in the context of non-cardioembolic strokes. In fact a survey of neurologists prior to the WASID trial showed clinicians at the time were equally divided between those who preferred warfarin and those who preferred antiplatelet agents in this context.    ,/wiki/WASID,,
Among postmenopausal women how does combination estrogen/progesterone hormone replacement therapy affect the incidences of skeletal fractures CAD breast cancer and thrombosis?,At the end of the 20th century observational studies suggested that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may reduce the incidence of CAD in women[1] at the expense of more endometrial cancer and VTE.[2] The 1998 HERS trial[3] found no difference between combined estrogen/progesterone and placebo for secondary prevention of CVD in women at five years (though there was an increased risk with hormone therapy in the first two years of follow-up). A randomized study of this medication for primary prevention of CVD in women had not yet been performed.,/wiki/WHI,,
In patients with severe COPD receiving triple therapy (tiotropium salmeterol and fluticasone) is the withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids associated with an increase in the frequency of COPD exacerbations?,Initial pharmacological management of high-risk COPD (either by GOLD ≥3 severity or frequent exacerbations) is with long-acting bronchodilators plus an ICS.[1] This approach is based upon the evidence from TORCH (2007) which found that these therapies reduced the rate of lung function decline the frequency of COPD exacerbations and yielded symptom improvement. Importantly in TORCH neither bronchdilators nor ICS improved overall survival and ICS was associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia. A step-down approach in which ICS was withdrawn was subsequently proposed but whether this step-down approach would be non-inferior to ICS continuation had not been formally evaluated.[2],/wiki/WISDOM,,
In patients on oral anticoagulation undergoing PCI does using clopidogrel alone reduce the risk of bleeding compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin? ,Antiplatelet therapy and oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy each increase risk of bleeding. 20-30% of patients with an indication for long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) have concomitant ischemic heart disease that requires PCI with stenting. In these cases the 2006 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines recommended dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in addition to OAC (triple therapy) [Class IIb level C recommendation] [1]. However it was known that triple therapy increases the risk of both fatal and non-fatal bleeding events[2][3]. No prospective randomized controlled data was available to guide the decision to use dual vs. triple therapy in patients on OAC undergoing PCI.,/wiki/WOEST,,
In men with hyperlipidemia what is the benefit of pravastatin in reducing CV events? ,The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) was the first trial to demonstrate a significant reduction in CV events with statin therapy for primary prevention. WOSCOPS randomized 6595 middle-aged men with hyperlipidemia and no previous history of MI to pravastatin or placebo. This trial demonstrated a 31% relative risk reduction of coronary events an effect that was seen within 6 months of randomization.  The absolute benefit was 2.4%; therefore the number needed to treat was 33 patients in order to prevent one coronary event at 5 years. ,/wiki/WOSCOPS,,
In mechanically ventilated patients what predictors determine success or failure of weaning patients from mechanical ventilation?,For years clinical gestalt was the primary driver for decisions to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Problems with its subjectivity and difficulties standardizing in clinical trials led to the development of objective measures for estimating the success of weaning from mechanical ventilation. ,/wiki/Yang-Tobin_Study,,
